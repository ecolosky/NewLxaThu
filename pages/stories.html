        <h1 style="color:white;">The Stories</h1>
        <p>I guess it's mostly about the stories.</p>
        <p>Stories of things we did. Stories of things we wish we had done. Stories of things we wish we hadn't done. But always stories.</p>
        <p>One of my earliest memories of Lambda Chi Alpha is from rush night, the first month of my freshman year. Along with other freshmen I was brought on a tour of the house, a tour that ended in Room 3 on the top floor. There, Pete Kelly was holding court, regaling everyone with stories of past exploits. But, he hastened to point out to us all, the idea wasn't to keep telling stories of past deeds and misdeeds. Rather, it was to go out and do new things that could become the subject of future stories.</p>
        <p>I was intrigued.</p>
        <p>At our Reunions, some of the best moments are the telling of, and the listening to, stories from our past. Stories that should never be lost or forgotten.</p>
        <p>And that's what this section of the Memorabilia Vault is about--The Stories. They're introduced below by title or catch phrase. Click on one that strikes your fancy, and you'll get to read the full story.</p>
        <p>The stories are all true; we lived them. Of course, some of them may have grown in grandeur as they grew more distant in time.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to add a story to the collection, send one in and I'll add it. If you only have the name of a story or a fragment of a story, send that in--the colelctive mind can flesh it out.</p>

      <h3>Ronny Kowalewski Flunks German</h3>
      <br>recalled by Roger Grice<br>
      <p>Ronny Kowalewski was taking German. (I forget which level.) He got an A
      on the first test, a B on the second, a C on the third, and a D on the final.
      His grade for the course? <b>F</b>.
      </p>
      <p>Ronny was surprised, so he went to the professor to ask what had happened. The professor explained that F was the next letter in the series, and the grade remained F.</p>

      <h3>We All Pass 13</h3><br>recalled by Roger Grice<br>
      <p>Back in the day, Poly numbered courses by number only--no letters to identify the department.
      But they assigned each department a range of numbers, so once you learned the code, you could figure out
      what they were. EE courses were in the 400s, math courses in the 600s. Among the most dreaded ones were the
      low numbers--below 100--the Aero courses. The worst of all was Statics and Dynamics--course number 13. (Some sick
      mind must have decided to assign that number to the course.)<br>
      <img src="img/stories/1.gif" height="150"><img src="img/stories/3.gif" height="150">
      <p>We were all struggling (well, at least most of us); I pulled a 6 on the midterm. Just before finals week, Professor
      Salkind (remember him?) showed his class eight problems that "it would be good to know how to do."
      Fortunately Suki and Vito were in the class. They brought the problems to the house, and we spent the weekend figuring out
    </p>
      how to do the problems and then memorizing the solutions.
      </p>
      <p>When we showed up for the final, there were the eight problems. Almost exactly! (One was changed to work around the
      other angle in the right-angle triangle than we had prepped.) We managed to spit back the answers we had memorized and passed!

    <div id="lppam" class="story"><h3>Lenny, Peter, Paul, and Mary</h3><br>recalled by Roger Grice<br>
      <p>We didn't have as much audio equipment then as college students do now. We did have a nice
      stereo that we won in a Marlboro contest. (There's another story there.) But at one point in
      '62 or '63, we only had two records in the house. One was Peter, Paul, and Mary's first record, and the
      other was a Lenny Bruce record. One or the other of them was playing in the chapter room at almost any hour of the day.
      So, on the way down from the bedrooms to the kitchen, we would stop in and listen to a few songs or a few skits.
      </p><p>Lenny Bruce was infused in our brain. The thing to do was to try to have conversations using only lines from
      Lenny's skits. Not easy. The most useful line was one from a skit in which a guy is locked in an airplane bathroom.
      When asked what was the matter, the answer was a muffled "I can't tell you." Our standard response to questions was
      to put our hands over our mouths and mutter in a low voice, "I can't tell you." Funny in conversations around the house.
      Probably not the best of responses when asked questions in class.

    <div id="cm" class="story"><h3>Celestial Manor</h3><br>recalled by Roger Grice<br>

      <p>When it came time for people to move into the fraternity house in the fall of '63,
      we realized that the entire top floor was occupied by seniors. (This is the same group that
      was the Pledge Class from Hell their first year, the Dreaded Sophomores their second year, and
      something forgotten but probably unspeakable their third year.)
      <img src="img/stories/406250.JPG" width="150" align="right">
      It was thus deemed that only those worthy to live there should live there. (Yes, it is
      reverse logic, but it sounded good.)
      It was decided that the floor should be given
      an appropriate title, one that hinted at the grandeur of its occupants.
      </p><p>And if we were obnoxious as freshmen, sophomores, and juniors, we were truly unbearable
      as seniors. (But we were worth it.)

    <div id="clm" class="story"><h3>Celeste L. Manor</h3><br>recalled by Roger Grice<br>
      <p>It didn't take all that long for a Miss Celeste L. Manor to make her appearance.
      She first appeared in a late-night bull session and made her second appearance on an
      application to join the Columbia Record Club. Records started appearing at the house for her,
      and we opened them for her and used them at parties. Miss Manor expanded her interest to magazine subscriptions
      and other free offers. The residents of Celestial Manor usually knew what to expect in the mail, but
      then brothers who were not residents of The Manor started filling out applications, and the flow of goodies
      increased.
      </p><p>Miss Manor was not good about paying her bills, so the freebies started to taper off. A bill
      collector did knock on the door one time, but we explained that it was a fraternity house and women
      did not live there.

      <p>When Dimitri Moursellas was High Epsilon, we really enjoyed busting his chops. (Of course, we enjoyed busting
      them when he wasn't High Epsilon, but that's another story.)<img src="img/stories/XAAB7209.gif" height="200" align="right">
      </p><p>Dimitri had his High Epsilon closet in the basement, where he kept party supplies, including
      liquid refreshments. From time to time, some of the refreshments would "disappear," and Dimitri would become
      angry--much to the amusement of of those who had participated in the disappearance. Dimitri decided to take control,
      so he went out and bought a lock for the door. Not a padlock, but a fancy one like you might find on
      the inside of a front door.
      </p><p>Unfortunately, he put the lock on the outside of the door, so with a little ingenuity an a piece of plastic
      or cardboard, the door could be opened, so some supplies could be taken for a walk, and the door closed
      again as if nothing had happened. This further irritated Dimitri.
      </p><p>Eventually it was decided that it really wasn't fair to confiscate supplies that were needed for parties,
      but the scam was too good a one to stop. A compromise was reached. Before raiding the closet, we would go to
      the store and buy stuff--usually beer--that was comparable, but a different brand. We would then go into the
      High Epsilon closet and replace the beer--usually on a one-for-one basis--and lock the door.
      </p><p>Dimitri didn't figure out what was happening (unless he's reading this), and technically, supplies were not missing, so there was nothing to complain about.

    <div id="twem" class="story"><h3>The Wonderful Electrodes Machine (probably a collection of stories)</h3>
      <br>Recalled by Roger Grice<br>
      <p>Pete Kelly was the owner of the machine, of course.
      </p><p>It was an old hand-cranked generator with two leads coming out, each ending in a hand grip.
      There was also an iron core that could be inserted into the solenoid or removed. When the hand crank was
      turned, the machine generated electricity, and the person (most often, but not always, a pledge) holding
      the two hand grips received a continuous electrical shock.
      <p><img src="img/stories/XAAB7395.gif" height="200" align="middle"></p>
      When the iron core was removed, the intensity
      of the shock increased dramatically. (At the time, we understood the physics behind why this happened,
      but I doubt that many of us do today.)
      </p><p>There are some pictures on this site of the machine in use. Typically, it was used at the chapter house,
      with one person turning the crank, one person holding the hand grips, and other people watching on. There's also
      a picture of the machine being used at a dance at Poly. A tub was filled with water, and dimes were placed at the
      bottom of the tub. One of the grips was placed in the water, and people got to hold the other hand grip and
      try to pick up the dimes at the bottom of the tub.
      </p><p>Kelly and I talked about the Wonderful Electrodes machine recently. Seems that it disappeared or was
      taken during a move from one apartment to another. But the memory of it remains.

      <br>Recalled by Don Hayes and Roger Grice<br>
      <p>Back in the day, Pi Kappa Phi's house was at 33 Sidney Place, right across the street from us.
      (They're no longer there; the Pi Kap chapter at Poly folded in the late '90s.) The proximity of the
      only two fraternities on campus to own their own houses (three others rented lofts) did make for
      instances of a regular Fraternity Row right in the midst of Brooklyn Heights.
      <img src="img/stories/XAAB7008.gif" height="200" align="right">
      </p><p>The coming of spring to Brooklyn also marked the coming of water balloons. There were water balloon fights
      in the house, in the back yard, and occasionally with the Pi Kaps across the street. Now, water balloon fights in a
      classy residential neighborhood were not looked upon kindly. And to make matters worse, the Pi Kap house was right next door to the convent associated with St. Charles Boremeo Church.
      </p><p>You can see the punch line of this one coming, right? One of the water balloons being tossed across the street
      went wide of its mark. It didn't it a fraternity guy; it hit a nun. The pastor did come over and talk to both houses on that one.

      <p>Seems strange and long ago in these days where smoking is prohibited in most places, but in the 60s
      cigarette companies were welcome on college campus to distribute free sample cigarettes and hold promotional contests.
      <img src="img/stories/marlboro_red.gif" height="200" align="left">
      </p><p>Roger recalls:
      </p><p>Marlboro was a frequent visitor to campus, and each year they had a competition: the group that brought in the most points in empty cigarette
      packs won a prize. (Marlboro boxes were worth 5 points; Philip Morris Commanders were worth 10 point. I even switched brands to double
      my point contribution.) We tried to win each year, but we didn't. AEPi managed to win each year, with a big elaborate display
      of bringing in empty packs--strung together in chains, piled together, etc. One year, we found out their secret: after the competition,
      the packs entered into the competition were throw away in bins outside Poly. AEPi went there right after the dumping and retrieved their own
      entries, plus the entries of everybody else. Of course, once we learned the secret, we got there first.
      </p><p>Thus, in 1963, we won a very nice console stereo hi-fi for the chapter room. Unfortunately we still didn't have that much money for records.
      </p><p>Having a much better memory, Al Ward adds:
      </p><p>AEPi has won the Marlboro contest before. We are told by a Lambda Chi from UMass that they have won a similar contest and have retained all the cigarette packs that won that contest. One weekend we (Carbone, Ward, and ??) drove to Amherst, Mass. and picked up those cigarette packs loose and drove back to NY. After unloading those packs on the floor of 36 Sidney, we wondered if we had enough to win our contest. So we went over to the AEPi house which was on Jay St. adjacent to a parking lot. While Ed Waldbusser served as look-out. we climbed an outside staircase to the back of the AEPi chapter house. We opened the door (it wasn't locked). To our astonishment, AEPi's cache of cigarette packs was staring us in the face. Looking down the hallway, we noticed that there were people in the chapter house. We proceeded with the heist right under AEPi's noses. We took ALL the AEPi cigarette packs. A few days later we won the contest, a stereo! Vic Carbone, Ed Waldbusser and myself were involved in the heist. There may have been a couple of other brothers involved but I don't remember who they were.
      </p><p>Silvia Giardina adds that her sorority also won a hi-fi in a Marlboro contest. We were persistent (or creative) smokers in those days.

    <div id="afswf" class="story"><h3>After finals smoker water fight with hoses and garbage cans</h3>
      <br>Title recalled by Don Hayes, story recalled by Roger Grice, although maybe it's a different story<br>
      <p>One of the most enduring traditions during the Golden Era was the after finals smoker, a way to let
      off steam at the end of the semester. It was not a particularly organized affair, but there was an official time
      at which a keg arrived and was tapped. People who ended finals early, or those lucky few who had no finals,
      often started celebrating before the official event.
      </p><p>The after finals smoker for the fall semester took place in January--the semester started later and ended later than it did today. It was always cold in Brooklyn then, so there was some restraint. The spring after finals smoker in June, on the other hand, was a different story. Weather was warm, and school really was over for the year.
      </p><p>Water activities usually started with small water balloons or mugs of water. Sometimes it escalated. Sometimes it escalated big time--hoses and garbage cans full of water were tossed around--inside the house and out. If you look
      through the pictures on this site, you're sure to find some of wet people standing in water that covered the floor.
      And the house is still standing.

    <div id="pzpr" class="story"><h3>Prof. Zukofsky’s Poetry Reading</h3>
      <br>Recalled by Don Hayes, Ed Horvath, and Roger Grice<br>
      <p>Prof. Zukofski taught English at Poly. He was thin.
      How thin was he?  He was the only person who could cross his legs,
      have he upper part of his legs parallel to the ground and both feet were
      flat on the ground. He had heavy, craggy eyebrows, that probably weighed more than the
      rest of him.
      </p><p>Ed Horvath and Cal Gomez were in one of his classes, and Prof. Zukofski announced
      that he was giving a poetry reading. The guys attended hoping to better their grades.
      It was a typical (for the day) Greenwich Village poetry reading, probably good
      for serious poetry buffs, a stretch for students just looking to butter up a prof.
      From here on the story gets sketchy, but they both passed.
      </p><p> Cal Gomez may be a good source of information.  He took the class with Ed.
      Vic Carbone may somehow be involved in this one too.

    <div id="trc" class="story"><h3>The Retsina Cardinal</h3>
      <br>Recalled (vaguely) by Roger Grice and Don Hayes<br>
      <p>One of the popular drinking games in the early 60s was "Cardinal."
      The game involved having a glass with some sort of drink (and the drink determined
      which type of Cardinal you became--Beer Cardinal was, of course, the lowest, Scotch cardinal
      was at or near the top). The game involved going through a carefully prescribed series
      of words and actions, during the course of which the drink was consumed. If any of the words
      or actions was done out of sequence or done incorrectly, the person had to chug the drink and
      start again with a fresh one. Obviously, the more a person started to lose, the less the chances
      of completing successfully.
      <img src="img/stories/retsina.gif" height="200" align="left">
      </p><p>One summer night, someone (probably George Kastanos) brought a bottle of retsina to the house.
      Retsina is a popular (or at least widely known) Greek wine flavored with pine resin. It tastes like
      gasoline. Not even good gasoline. It was determined that this was the night that Roger and Don would
      make Cardinal.
      </p><p>Roger went first. And even though he was not (and still isn't) the most organized of people, he managed to
      get through the sequence of steps and became a Cardinal.
      </p><p>Then it was Don's turn. Things didn't go so well for Don. He started to miss and was having trouble with
      the horrible taste of the retsina. Then he started having trouble with the effects of the retsina. He needed
      to call a halt to things.
      </p><p>A while later when we all got back from Coney Island and were sitting around room 7, Don left the room for a
      bit. While he was out, those left in the room, Roger, Pete Kelly, probably Charlie Opalek, maybe others) all
      poured glasses of retsina and appeared to be enjoying it when Don came back into the room. Don took one look and one whiff, turned around, and went running out of the room.
      </p><p>We've never really decided whether people actually ever drank retsina for enjoyment, or if it was a bad joke.
      But we could always gross Don out by mentioning retsina or by mentioning "retsina Fizzies." (Fizzies were
      tablets you could buy in grocery stores at the time. They were like flavored Alka-Seltzer--you put one in
      a glass of water and you had a flavored carbonated beverage. Not a particularly good one; Fizzies didn't last that
      long.)
