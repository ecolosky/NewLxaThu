        <h1 style="color:white;">The Stories</h1>
        <p>I guess it's mostly about the stories.</p>
        <p>Stories of things we did. Stories of things we wish we had done. Stories of things we wish we hadn't done. But always stories.</p>
        <p>One of my earliest memories of Lambda Chi Alpha is from rush night, the first month of my freshman year. Along with other freshmen I was brought on a tour of the house, a tour that ended in Room 3 on the top floor. There, Pete Kelly was holding court, regaling everyone with stories of past exploits. But, he hastened to point out to us all, the idea wasn't to keep telling stories of past deeds and misdeeds. Rather, it was to go out and do new things that could become the subject of future stories.</p>
        <p>I was intrigued.</p>
        <p>At our Reunions, some of the best moments are the telling of, and the listening to, stories from our past. Stories that should never be lost or forgotten.</p>
        <p>And that's what this section of the Memorabilia Vault is about--The Stories. They're introduced below by title or catch phrase. Click on one that strikes your fancy, and you'll get to read the full story.</p>
        <p>The stories are all true; we lived them. Of course, some of them may have grown in grandeur as they grew more distant in time.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to add a story to the collection, send one in and I'll add it. If you only have the name of a story or a fragment of a story, send that in--the colelctive mind can flesh it out.</p>

      <p>Ronny Kowalewski was taking German. (I forget which level.) He got an A

      His grade for the course? <b>F</b>.

      <h3>We All Pass 13</h3><br>recalled by Roger Grice<br>
      <p>Back in the day, Poly numbered courses by number only--no letters to identify the department.
      But they assigned each department a range of numbers, so once you learned the code, you could figure out
      what they were. EE courses were in the 400s, math courses in the 600s. Among the most dreaded ones were the
      low numbers--below 100--the Aero courses. The worst of all was Statics and Dynamics--course number 13. (Some sick
      mind must have decided to assign that number to the course.)<br>
      <img src="img/stories/1.gif" height="150"><img src="img/stories/3.gif" height="150">
      <p>We were all struggling (well, at least most of us); I pulled a 6 on the midterm. Just before finals week, Professor
      Salkind (remember him?) showed his class eight problems that "it would be good to know how to do."
      Fortunately Suki and Vito were in the class. They brought the problems to the house, and we spent the weekend figuring out
    </p>
      how to do the problems and then memorizing the solutions.
      </p>
      <p>When we showed up for the final, there were the eight problems. Almost exactly! (One was changed to work around the
      other angle in the right-angle triangle than we had prepped.) We managed to spit back the answers we had memorized and passed!

    <div id="lppam" class="story"><h3>Lenny, Peter, Paul, and Mary</h3><br>recalled by Roger Grice<br>
      <p>We didn't have as much audio equipment then as college students do now. We did have a nice
      stereo that we won in a Marlboro contest. (There's another story there.) But at one point in
      '62 or '63, we only had two records in the house. One was Peter, Paul, and Mary's first record, and the
      other was a Lenny Bruce record. One or the other of them was playing in the chapter room at almost any hour of the day.
      So, on the way down from the bedrooms to the kitchen, we would stop in and listen to a few songs or a few skits.
      </p><p>Lenny Bruce was infused in our brain. The thing to do was to try to have conversations using only lines from
      Lenny's skits. Not easy. The most useful line was one from a skit in which a guy is locked in an airplane bathroom.
      When asked what was the matter, the answer was a muffled "I can't tell you." Our standard response to questions was
      to put our hands over our mouths and mutter in a low voice, "I can't tell you." Funny in conversations around the house.
      Probably not the best of responses when asked questions in class.

      <p>When it came time for people to move into the fraternity house in the fall of '63,
      we realized that the entire top floor was occupied by seniors. (This is the same group that
      was the Pledge Class from Hell their first year, the Dreaded Sophomores their second year, and
      something forgotten but probably unspeakable their third year.)
      <img src="img/stories/406250.JPG" width="150" align="right">
      It was thus deemed that only those worthy to live there should live there. (Yes, it is
      reverse logic, but it sounded good.)
      It was decided that the floor should be given
      an appropriate title, one that hinted at the grandeur of its occupants.
      </p><p>And if we were obnoxious as freshmen, sophomores, and juniors, we were truly unbearable
      as seniors. (But we were worth it.)

      <p>It didn't take all that long for a Miss Celeste L. Manor to make her appearance.
      She first appeared in a late-night bull session and made her second appearance on an
      application to join the Columbia Record Club. Records started appearing at the house for her,
      and we opened them for her and used them at parties. Miss Manor expanded her interest to magazine subscriptions
      and other free offers. The residents of Celestial Manor usually knew what to expect in the mail, but
      then brothers who were not residents of The Manor started filling out applications, and the flow of goodies
      increased.
      </p><p>Miss Manor was not good about paying her bills, so the freebies started to taper off. A bill
      collector did knock on the door one time, but we explained that it was a fraternity house and women
      did not live there.

      <p>When Dimitri Moursellas was High Epsilon, we really enjoyed busting his chops. (Of course, we enjoyed busting
      them when he wasn't High Epsilon, but that's another story.)<img src="img/stories/XAAB7209.gif" height="200" align="right">
      </p><p>Dimitri had his High Epsilon closet in the basement, where he kept party supplies, including
      liquid refreshments. From time to time, some of the refreshments would "disappear," and Dimitri would become
      angry--much to the amusement of of those who had participated in the disappearance. Dimitri decided to take control,
      so he went out and bought a lock for the door. Not a padlock, but a fancy one like you might find on
      the inside of a front door.
      </p><p>Unfortunately, he put the lock on the outside of the door, so with a little ingenuity an a piece of plastic
      or cardboard, the door could be opened, so some supplies could be taken for a walk, and the door closed
      again as if nothing had happened. This further irritated Dimitri.
      </p><p>Eventually it was decided that it really wasn't fair to confiscate supplies that were needed for parties,
      but the scam was too good a one to stop. A compromise was reached. Before raiding the closet, we would go to
      the store and buy stuff--usually beer--that was comparable, but a different brand. We would then go into the
      High Epsilon closet and replace the beer--usually on a one-for-one basis--and lock the door.
      </p><p>Dimitri didn't figure out what was happening (unless he's reading this), and technically, supplies were not missing, so there was nothing to complain about.

      <br>Recalled by Roger Grice<br>
      <p>Pete Kelly was the owner of the machine, of course.
      </p><p>It was an old hand-cranked generator with two leads coming out, each ending in a hand grip.
      There was also an iron core that could be inserted into the solenoid or removed. When the hand crank was
      turned, the machine generated electricity, and the person (most often, but not always, a pledge) holding
      the two hand grips received a continuous electrical shock.
      <p><img src="img/stories/XAAB7395.gif" height="200" align="middle"></p>
      When the iron core was removed, the intensity
      of the shock increased dramatically. (At the time, we understood the physics behind why this happened,
      but I doubt that many of us do today.)
      </p><p>There are some pictures on this site of the machine in use. Typically, it was used at the chapter house,
      with one person turning the crank, one person holding the hand grips, and other people watching on. There's also
      a picture of the machine being used at a dance at Poly. A tub was filled with water, and dimes were placed at the
      bottom of the tub. One of the grips was placed in the water, and people got to hold the other hand grip and
      try to pick up the dimes at the bottom of the tub.
      </p><p>Kelly and I talked about the Wonderful Electrodes machine recently. Seems that it disappeared or was
      taken during a move from one apartment to another. But the memory of it remains.

      <br>Recalled by Don Hayes and Roger Grice<br>
      <p>Back in the day, Pi Kappa Phi's house was at 33 Sidney Place, right across the street from us.
      (They're no longer there; the Pi Kap chapter at Poly folded in the late '90s.) The proximity of the
      only two fraternities on campus to own their own houses (three others rented lofts) did make for
      instances of a regular Fraternity Row right in the midst of Brooklyn Heights.
      <img src="img/stories/XAAB7008.gif" height="200" align="right">
      </p><p>The coming of spring to Brooklyn also marked the coming of water balloons. There were water balloon fights
      in the house, in the back yard, and occasionally with the Pi Kaps across the street. Now, water balloon fights in a
      classy residential neighborhood were not looked upon kindly. And to make matters worse, the Pi Kap house was right next door to the convent associated with St. Charles Boremeo Church.
      </p><p>You can see the punch line of this one coming, right? One of the water balloons being tossed across the street
      went wide of its mark. It didn't it a fraternity guy; it hit a nun. The pastor did come over and talk to both houses on that one.

      <p>Seems strange and long ago in these days where smoking is prohibited in most places, but in the 60s
      cigarette companies were welcome on college campus to distribute free sample cigarettes and hold promotional contests.
      <img src="img/stories/marlboro_red.gif" height="200" align="left">
      </p><p>Roger recalls:
      </p><p>Marlboro was a frequent visitor to campus, and each year they had a competition: the group that brought in the most points in empty cigarette
      packs won a prize. (Marlboro boxes were worth 5 points; Philip Morris Commanders were worth 10 point. I even switched brands to double
      my point contribution.) We tried to win each year, but we didn't. AEPi managed to win each year, with a big elaborate display
      of bringing in empty packs--strung together in chains, piled together, etc. One year, we found out their secret: after the competition,
      the packs entered into the competition were throw away in bins outside Poly. AEPi went there right after the dumping and retrieved their own
      entries, plus the entries of everybody else. Of course, once we learned the secret, we got there first.
      </p><p>Thus, in 1963, we won a very nice console stereo hi-fi for the chapter room. Unfortunately we still didn't have that much money for records.
      </p><p>Having a much better memory, Al Ward adds:
      </p><p>AEPi has won the Marlboro contest before. We are told by a Lambda Chi from UMass that they have won a similar contest and have retained all the cigarette packs that won that contest. One weekend we (Carbone, Ward, and ??) drove to Amherst, Mass. and picked up those cigarette packs loose and drove back to NY. After unloading those packs on the floor of 36 Sidney, we wondered if we had enough to win our contest. So we went over to the AEPi house which was on Jay St. adjacent to a parking lot. While Ed Waldbusser served as look-out. we climbed an outside staircase to the back of the AEPi chapter house. We opened the door (it wasn't locked). To our astonishment, AEPi's cache of cigarette packs was staring us in the face. Looking down the hallway, we noticed that there were people in the chapter house. We proceeded with the heist right under AEPi's noses. We took ALL the AEPi cigarette packs. A few days later we won the contest, a stereo! Vic Carbone, Ed Waldbusser and myself were involved in the heist. There may have been a couple of other brothers involved but I don't remember who they were.
      </p><p>Silvia Giardina adds that her sorority also won a hi-fi in a Marlboro contest. We were persistent (or creative) smokers in those days.

    <div id="afswf" class="story"><h3>After finals smoker water fight with hoses and garbage cans</h3>
      <br>Title recalled by Don Hayes, story recalled by Roger Grice, although maybe it's a different story<br>
      <p>One of the most enduring traditions during the Golden Era was the after finals smoker, a way to let
      off steam at the end of the semester. It was not a particularly organized affair, but there was an official time
      at which a keg arrived and was tapped. People who ended finals early, or those lucky few who had no finals,
      often started celebrating before the official event.
      </p><p>The after finals smoker for the fall semester took place in January--the semester started later and ended later than it did today. It was always cold in Brooklyn then, so there was some restraint. The spring after finals smoker in June, on the other hand, was a different story. Weather was warm, and school really was over for the year.
      </p><p>Water activities usually started with small water balloons or mugs of water. Sometimes it escalated. Sometimes it escalated big time--hoses and garbage cans full of water were tossed around--inside the house and out. If you look
      through the pictures on this site, you're sure to find some of wet people standing in water that covered the floor.
      And the house is still standing.

      How thin was he?  He was the only person who could cross his legs,

    <div id="trc" class="story"><h3>The Retsina Cardinal</h3>
      <br>Recalled (vaguely) by Roger Grice and Don Hayes<br>
      <p>One of the popular drinking games in the early 60s was "Cardinal."
      The game involved having a glass with some sort of drink (and the drink determined
      which type of Cardinal you became--Beer Cardinal was, of course, the lowest, Scotch cardinal
      was at or near the top). The game involved going through a carefully prescribed series
      of words and actions, during the course of which the drink was consumed. If any of the words
      or actions was done out of sequence or done incorrectly, the person had to chug the drink and
      start again with a fresh one. Obviously, the more a person started to lose, the less the chances
      of completing successfully.
      <img src="img/stories/retsina.gif" height="200" align="left">
      </p><p>One summer night, someone (probably George Kastanos) brought a bottle of retsina to the house.
      Retsina is a popular (or at least widely known) Greek wine flavored with pine resin. It tastes like
      gasoline. Not even good gasoline. It was determined that this was the night that Roger and Don would
      make Cardinal.
      </p><p>Roger went first. And even though he was not (and still isn't) the most organized of people, he managed to
      get through the sequence of steps and became a Cardinal.
      </p><p>Then it was Don's turn. Things didn't go so well for Don. He started to miss and was having trouble with
      the horrible taste of the retsina. Then he started having trouble with the effects of the retsina. He needed
      to call a halt to things.
      </p><p>A while later when we all got back from Coney Island and were sitting around room 7, Don left the room for a
      bit. While he was out, those left in the room, Roger, Pete Kelly, probably Charlie Opalek, maybe others) all
      poured glasses of retsina and appeared to be enjoying it when Don came back into the room. Don took one look and one whiff, turned around, and went running out of the room.
      </p><p>We've never really decided whether people actually ever drank retsina for enjoyment, or if it was a bad joke.
      But we could always gross Don out by mentioning retsina or by mentioning "retsina Fizzies." (Fizzies were
      tablets you could buy in grocery stores at the time. They were like flavored Alka-Seltzer--you put one in
      a glass of water and you had a flavored carbonated beverage. Not a particularly good one; Fizzies didn't last that
      long.)

    <div class = "story" id="13"><h3>Our Good-Will Event: The Annual Blood Drive</h3>
    <br>Recalled by Roger Grice<br>
    <p>Our annual philanthropy event was sponsoring a Red Cross Blood Drive at Poly.
    We made arrangements with the Red Cross to come to Poly. There was a prize for the
    organization that got credited for the most blood donations--a keg of beer.
    </p>
    <img src="img/stories/blood.gif" height=200 align=left>
    <p>One of the loopholes in the rules was that you didn't have to actually give blood--just
    register to do so and start going through the process. If you were rejected along the way,
    you still got credit.
    </p>
    <p>One time George Kastanos and someone else (Joe Giardina or Joe Alario perhaps?) wanted
    to get out of actually donating, so they ran up and down the stairs at Poly (an eight-storey
    building) figuring they would then get rejected for high blood pressure. They must have been
    in better shape than they thought--their blood pressure was fine.
    </p>
    <p>One of the enjoyable parts of donating was driving the nurses crazy. While they were trying
    to keep us lying still while we were donating, we were sitting up and talking to other brothers
    across the room. As we were leaving, they gave us instructions for the next several hours (lots of fluids,
    etc.). One of the restrictions was no smoking for several hours. We said that we would do that, but we would be standing there with a cigarette in one hand and a lighter in the other. The one rule that was followed by
    pledges was that there could be no strenuous activity for a few hours. That ruled out pushups for the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>The prize keg was usually used for an upcoming party. But not always--see next story.</p>

    <br>Recalled by Roger Grice<br>
    <p>The blood-drive prize keg was usually delivered several days after the blood drive
    and given to the High Epsilon for the next scheduled party.
    <img src="img/stories/B45407.JPG" height=200 align=right>
    But one year (and I think Dimitri was
    the much besieged High Epsilon at the time), there was a knock on the fraternity house door
    on the night of the blood drive. Representatives from Poly were there with cases of beer in cans.
    They said that they didn't have a keg, but they had the equivalent in cans. We said that was fine.
    </p>
    <p>The High Epsilon not being there, we were determined to guard the prize. And maybe sample
    some of the prize. And then the prize was gone. When the High Epsilon checked for the beer, it was
    already gone. This incident may have led to the ill-fated lock on the High Epsilon closet.

    <p>We would gather at the top of the cellar stairs, and on signal we would flip on the cellar light and rush down the stairs as fast as we could. The light startled the cockroaches that were wandering around the cellar, and
    they would scramble for cover. The idea was to stomp and squish as many of them as possible before they found
    hiding places. Usually we left the squished ones there. Sometimes we brought them upstairs to annoy others. </p>

    <br>Recalled by Roger Grice<br>
    <p>Back in the day when it was OK (even expected) to have beer parties inside Poly, the evening students would have an Evening Students' Smoker each year. (Maybe even each semester.) The smoker was restricted to evening students, but there was never anyone checking at the door.
    </p>
    <p>We would regularly attend these smokers, showing up in small groups, figuring that since many of us were taking night classes from time to time we were entitled. Plus, there was free beer.
    </p>
    <p>Usually our presence passed without notice, but not always. I recall one time when the president of the organization spotted us and yelled out "Day Students!" or maybe a somewhat more colorful version of the phrase and came running after us to kick us out. Being younger than him, we managed to scoot out before he got to us, carrying our cans of beer with us. Not sure which was more enjoyable: the free beer or pulling a con.

    <p>Joe Giardina grew a moustache in the early months of 1961. While he was at the house during Hell Week for Theta-Upsilon 425 through Theta-Upsilon 431,
    the Brothers told the Worms to shave Joe's moustache off. We tried to get out of it, but they insisted.
    </p>
    <p>Cleverly, we removed the blade from the razor and while soaping Joe's upper lip, we tried to explain to him that things would be OK, that we were really on his side. We went though the motions, but, of course, the moustache stayed. The Worms caught it from the Brothers. But this was nothing compared to the ruckus the next morning when a clean-shaven Joe Giardina approached the Words screaming that we had shaved his moustache. Our denials met with scorn, and we were in deeper trouble.
      </p>
    <p>At the Candlelight Party that Saturday (the party to honor the newly initiated Brothers), Joe told us that he decided to shave the moustache off but wanted to see how much of a commotion he could make of it.

    <br>Recalled by Roger Grice<br>
    <p>ELCs used to be called "travelling secretaries." And it seemed that they always came from the Mid-West or the
    South and were a little shell-shocked to wind up in Brooklyn. They seemed to enjoy their visits, but we always got
    the sense that they enjoyed leaving even more.
    </p>
    <p>One semester we were expecting the traveling secretary to visit, and he arrived sometime fairly late in the
    evening. We brought him into the front room to welcome him and chat. Ed Horvath had fallen asleep, sitting up, on
    one of the couches in the front room, and the travelling secretary wound up sitting next to him. we were having an
    interesting time talking with him, but as we did so, Ed starting listing to the side and wound up leaning,
    still asleep, against the traveling secretary. Our laughter woke Ed up (sort of), and as the world came into focus, Ed looked at the guy and said, "Hey! I know you--you're the traveling sec!" We all got a chuckle, and the traveling secretary had this look of "Oh no, this place is weird."
    </p>
    <p>To regain some ground, I offered to make him some coffee. He asked for it to be strong, black, and hot. Probably
    the wrong thing to say to me. "Coffee" in those days meant a 24-ounce beer mug with far-too-much A&P instant coffee
    dumped in and then boiling water poured on top. It was like mud. One mug of it could keep you awake for the a whole
    finals week.
    </p>
    <p>I went down to the kitchen, made some mugs of coffee, came back to the front room, and gave him a mug. He looked sort of surprised at the size of the coffee, but took a sip. As he projectile-spat the coffee clear across the room, he stammered, "It's hot!" I wasn't quite sure what he had been expecting, but managed to mumble something like, "It's coffee."

    <img src="img/stories/O'Keefe's.JPG" height=200 align=right>
    <p>Frank was excited about his first trip to New York and very interested in the city. As we walked down Aitkin Place to Poly, he asked questions about the geography of the city. ("Is it really a bunch of islands connected by bridges and tunnels?") It all seemed strange to him. When we reached Court Street and made a left to get to Poly, Frank looked ahead and exclaimed, "Hey! It's O'Keefe's!" Apparently that was the one place he had heard a lot about.
    <p> Postscript: I was talking with Frank during breakfast at the 2002 General Assembly in Denver. He asked if O'Keefe's still made those great sandwiches for lunch. I had to admit that I had no idea that they served food. But apparently O'Keefe's fame is far and wide.

    <br>Recalled by Woo Han ThU 774
    <p>I came into Poly the fall of 1997. It was a fresh start. No one else from my high school came to Poly with me.  The freshmen week was over and we all were heading to the NSO (New Student Overnight) trip.  I was eager to make friends and a little scared.  I didn't want to meet idiots, like I had in H. S.
    <p>Everyone got off the bus and was divided into cabin rooms.  Our leaders was Tim Luu (TU 763) and Surva Aurangajeb (TU 766). They had fraternity letters on.  But I really didn't give it a second look.  I didn't come to college to join a fraternity.  I was fooled by the open house and tours, that painted Poly as a fun place to go.  It was the best con job anyone had done in the history of man kind.
    <p>Later on that day we all gathered in the middle of the camp site for a BBQ.  I was waiting in line to get my food when I hear these guys laughing and shouting.  They were a few places behind me.  They were talking to a little black chick who was also a student leader (she later tried to make a sorority at Poly, FAILED,  we called it GAMMA GAMMA MOO MOO).
    <p>I listened into their conversation.  It couldn't be helped, they were talking so loud.  And once in a while they would scream "WOOOOOOOO!!!". I found this very funny.
    <p>Once I got my food, they were still going on.  I decided that I might as well tag along with them.  At this point I haven't said a word to any one of them. I just listened in and smiled at what they were saying.  They had this girl with them with a red flash Gordon shirt on.  They all moved away from the group and sat under the shade of a large tree.  I just followed and sat down with them.
    <p>So It was me, the three guys, and the Flash Gordon girl.  They seemed not to really mind.  They were still joking and yelling "WOO!".  I still haven't talked yet. They seemed to notice that I had come along with them.  They didn't act hostile towards me, they actually introduced themselves.  Andrew (TU 776), Chris (AM), Peter (AM), and Violet.
    <p>They finally asked me, "What's your name?"
    <p>"I'm Woo."
    <p>They stopped talking.
    <p>"What's your name again?"
    <p>"My name is Woo."  Then I showed them my student ID.
    <p>They went crazy.  All together they Screamed "WOOOOOOOO!!".
    <p>I spent the rest of the trip with them.  I met other future brothers and that night we all slept outside freezing too death.  No one actually slept.  We talked all through the night.  We heard about some kids stealing a golf cart, the leaders came by and yelled at us to be quiet, and I kept disappearing (haha another story).
    <p>When we got back to Poly, a whole bunch of lambda was outside giving out hot-dogs.  I took a picture with them.  One of the three sprayed painted LAMBDA CHI ALPHA on his white shirt.
    <p>Finally we said our good-byes for the night, and said welcome to a new life at Poly.
    <p>That's how I entered Lambda.  By meeting these guys and then meeting Theta Upsilon through them.
    <p>All of my freshmen group had left Poly, through graduation or just got sick of it.  I still see them all.  But I'm the last one. Last active of the old school.  Last to see the ritual before the change.
    <p>This story has been told and retold by others and a few details have been lost, a lot was added.  It has grown to mythical proportions.  I'm surprised I didn't open up the heavens and descend down on the wings of fairies.  But this is what really happened.
    <p>It's an important memory too me. Without my friends from Lambda and those that left. I don't think I could have survived through my tenure at Polytech.
    <p>Well, That is all. I hope your stories will find a home on this site.

    <br>Recalled by Roger Grice<br>
    <p>For some strange reason, I signed up for ROTC in my freshman year. (I think I was trying to avoid
    water and the swimming test, which was the other option.) As you would imagine, I was a disaster as a ROTC cadet.
    My ROTC experience always makes me laugh extra hard at the ROTC scene in <i>Animal House</i>.
    <p>One big difference between me and Flounder though was that my company commander was also our High Kappa,
    Tom McNicholas. One day at early morning outdoor drill, it started to snow and we were told to break
    ranks, put on our overcoats, and fall back in. I did that, but those of you who have seen me in the morning
    know that it is not my best time of day--to say the least. Tom walked through the ranks doing an inspection.
    When he got to me, he didn't say anything. But he did unbutton my coat, tug on one side so that the buttons and
    the buttons holes were lined up straight, rebuttoned the coat, and then moved on.
    <p>ROTC cadets could get "merits" for good appearance at drill. Gung-ho cadets ranked them up every week--especially the Pershing Rifles (more about them elsewhere), but I didn't have much luck. I would spend endless hours spit-shining my shoes, time that could have been much better spent studying physics or calculus, all to no avail. One night a spent extra time and effort working on my shoes--they really looked good. During the inspection the next morning, Tom pointed out that my shoes were really shiny . . . but that there were fingerprints all over my "brass." Another day without getting a merit.
    <p>I stayed in ROTC for a two-year stint, but I never got much better at things. (I could go through all the moves
    for "right-shoulder arms" or "left-shoulder arms" and still wind up with the rifle on the wrong shoulder.)

    almost any hour of the day or night, they became well ingrained into the heads of those of us who lived in the house.
    At one point, the response
    to any question asked of someone who "lived in" was a line from Lenny Bruce, which made for interesting, but not too informative
    or intelligent, conversations.
    One of Lenny's skits was about a guy who locked himself in the bathroom of an airplane and resisted the stewardess's attempts to get him out. When she asked him what was wrong, he replied in a muffled voice, "I can't tell you."
    <p>So, when we were asked most questions (Are you going to class? What time is it? Have you seen so-and-so?), the response was to cover your mouth to muffle the sound and say "I can't tell you."

    <div class = "story" id="25"><h3>Roger Passes German IV</h3>
    <br>Recalled by Roger Grice<br>
    <p>German is not a language that can be spoken by people who mumble. It involves putting together more consonants
    than God ever wanted to be put together. I think you also need to be able to spit or drool while saying a lot of the
    words. Plus, many of the words are very long. If you learned to read by "sounding it out," this may not be that
    big a problem because the long words are often made up of smaller words all scrunched together. But if you
    learned to "read by sight," as I did, it can be a disaster.
    <p>I managed to pull B's in German I and II because Dr. Homberger found my attempts at the language humorous.
    Frau Sklar, did not find my attempts (plus my falling asleep in class) humorous at all, and I pulled the only C
    in a class of A's and B's. And then I wound up in her class for German IV.
    <p> The text for the class was Bertold Brecht's <i>Leben des Gallilai</i>, a play about Galileo. Not a word of
    English to be found.  This story kind of shows our age: Xerox machines were new--and rare. But Poly's library had one. It also had two other things vital to this story: (1) Vito Bassi working there, and (2) a copy of
    Bertold Brecht's <i>Life of Galileo</i>, and English version of the play. Vito saved my skin.
    <p>I pretty much gave up on trying to master German and became a master of the play in English.
    <p>In class, we went around the room, each guy, in strict Germanic order, reading one paragraph from the German text. When it was my turn, one of two things happened: (1) Frau Sklar ignored my existence and went directly to the next guy, or (2) she and I struggled painfully through the first sentence of the paragraph, and then she went on to the next guy.
    <p>Class discussions were of two types: (1) fairly basic questions and answers in German, and (2) more complex, philosophical discussions in English about the content of the play. Whenever an English question was asked, my hand shot up, and I gave a lengthy, thoughtful answer. By the time the German questions were asked, I had done more than my share of talking, so I was not called on.
    <p>There were two tests: a midterm and a final. Each test was a very long passage from the play that we were to translate from German into English. I struggled through the passage until I found some German that I could recognize. I then backspaced my brain to the beginning of that passage and went ahead. After commenting that the passage was too long for a word-for-word translation, I spit back the English translation--remembering to stop at the same point that the German did I did well on both tests.
    <p>German IV was offered in the spring semester, and that year I was determined to go to Mass every day for Lent. My intentions were good, but I usually overslept and missed morning Mass at St. Charles Boremeo (on Sidney Place) and had to go to a noon Mass at a church near Poly--causing me to miss German class on a few occasions. I explained to the teacher why I had missed class, and I guess the reason seemed good. At the end of the semester, she asked me if I found the anti-Church tone of the play had offended me. I said that it did not. (This may have also helped my grade.)
    <p>I wound up with an A in the class, much to my surprise and to the surprise of some students who spoke Yiddish at home and were very, very fluent in German.

    <p>Fall 1961. Ed and Roger had made it though their freshman year more or less unscarred. After commuting to Poly
    for that freshman year, both decided to move into the House. Room 4--top floor, front, the small room--was open
    and that was where they moved.
    <p>Details have blurred over time, but things started to get tossed around the room--towels, books, etc. Then a
    pillow got tossed out the window (maybe Eddie's--tossed by Roger) and then another (maybe Roger's--tossed by Eddie).
    Roger grabbed the mattress from Eddie's bed and ran out the door with it and down the stairs. Roger heard footsteps behind him on the stairs and turned around: it was Eddie running down the stairs with Roger's mattress dragging
    right behind.
    <p>The two guys and the two mattress (plus the pillows) wound up sitting on the sidewalk in front of 36 Sidney Place.
    Quite an occasion for laughter and the dragging stuff back up the stairs.
    <p>Things settled down, but it was a preview of things to come--the House was going to be a lively, unpredictable place for the next few years to come.
    <p>Sometime during that semester, space opened up in Room 2--top floor, back, large room--and the roomies moved into there. More space to spread out; more space to raise a ruckus.

    <div class = "story" id="27"><h3>The Blue Lemon</h3>
    <br>Recalled by Don Hayes, Charlie, Opalek, and Roger Grice<br>
    <p>Most of the places we went to in Brooklyn were within walking distance or reachable by public transportation. But there were two cars that figured into many of the longer trips: Charlie Opalek's Buick and "The Blue Lemon."
    <img src="img/stories/bluelemon.jpg" height=150 align=left>
    <p>The Blue Lemon was a Ford Falcon than belonged to Don Hayes's sister Mary. It was a good car when it ran, but it frequently had problems of unexplained and widely varying causes. (Somewhere along the way, Al Ward determined that if you took off the radiator cap and put it back on, things would be good again. Made no sense, but it sometimes worked.)
    <img src="img/stories/1950buick.jpg" height=150 align=right>
    <p>Mary allowed Don to bring the car to the fraternity house, but he was not to take it one extended trips. Don would disconnect the odometer and then reconnect it when he went home, so the mileage was never unreasonable. The Blue Lemon figured prominently in trips to Coney Island and some road trips to other chapters. Mary never found out about the extra mileage, until . . .
    <p>. . . many years later. By then, Mary was married to Charlie Opalek, and Charlie made mention of the escapades at a family dinner. (Thanksgiving?) She wasn't happy about it, but she still speaks to all of us.
    <p>Thanks, Mary!

    <div class = "story" id="28"><h3>Guys from UConn Come to Visit</h3>
    <br>Recalled by Roger Grice<br>
    <p>We got a call at the house one evening--it was Halloween or close to it--a group of brothers from the "Yukon chapter" were in the area and wanted to stop in; they were about an hour away. We didn't think we had a Yukon chapter, but we always welcomed visitors. And we thought we'd give them a special welcome.
    <p>We tied a rope to the front door and dragged the other end to the chapter room--so the door could be pulled open without anyone being there to open it. We rounded up a Halloween sound effects record and practices the parts we would play.
    <p>When the guys arrived, we had the sound effects playing, and the lighted "Lambda Chi Alpha" sign by the front door flickering (someone flipping the switch on and off). When the got to the front door, we pulled it slowly open, someone threw a plate from the top floor to the main floor so it would make a big crash, someone screamed, and Charlie Opalek tumbled down the flight of stairs and came to rest by the front door. At this point, Vic Carbone, in a black cape and elaborate black hat was supposed to run down the stairs carrying a candle and yell "Happy Halloween," but the visitors had let out a yelp and were running down Sidney Place as fast as they could to get to their car. Vic went running after them yelling "It was only a joke. It was only a joke."
    <p>We convinced them that it was safe to go into the house. They explained that they were from UCONN (University of Connecticut), not Alaska, and we sat around for the evening enjoying the beers they had brought and some we "found" in the Epsilon closet and swamping stories.
    <p>Some months later, we got a call from one of the UCONN guys saying that he would be stopping by the house and bringing some guys who had not been there before. Could we prepare another special welcome. Of course we could.
    <p>One wrinkle was that Charlie wasn't around, so I was designated as the person who would tumble down the flight of stairs. Being a novice at stair tumbling, I didn't realize that it was something that you didn't do in shorts. And Vic kept making me practice falling over and over until I got it right. (My knees and legs were badly skinned at this point.)
    <p>When the guys arrived, we all went through our paces. As I was lying face down by the front door, I could hear the visitors whispering to each other: "He's not breathing."  "They must have stolen a stiff from some lab at school." They new visitor let out a yell and started out the door, while all of us and the second-time visitor laughed our butts off.
    <p>Another fun-filled evening followed.

    <div class = "story" id="29"><h3>Vinny's Mercury</h3>
    <br>recalled by Tom McNicholas<br>
    <p>
    Vinny Morabit, Bob Kraemer and I worked nights and weekends at Dick and Jack's Sunoco stations on Atlantic Avenue and Bergen Street pumping gas, fixing flats and jumping dead batteries.  Vinny drove a cavernous, hump-backed 1950 Mercury that had a very bad case of road salt rust.  There was even an old rag that Vinny kept under the front seat in the winter, which he wrapped around his leg when driving to keep off the cold air coming through the perforated floorboard around the accelerator pedal.
    <img src="img/stories/1950merc.jpg" height=150 align=left>
    <p>
    One cold night after work we drove back to the chapter house, found a parking space, and Vinny went through a ritual of double checking all the car doors to be sure they were locked. When I asked him why he bothered to lock the car since no one would steal such a wreck, Vinny in his most serious voice explained that the last time he left the car unlocked someone shit on the backseat.
    <p>
    In recent years I too have become much more sensitive to the shortage of public toilets in NYC and elsewhere:
    "And as I sit and the parson talks, expounding of the Laws,
    I often think of Vinny's car, and if I locked my doors."
    <p>(Apologies to Robert Service)

    <p>I was threatened with it during my hell week, but none of us went through with it.
    The next season of pledges were faced with the same challenge.
    They went right for it.
    The great race from the basement dance floor to the third floor and back down to the starting point
    was indescribable.
    <p>The brothers couldn't control their laughter, so that most were on the floor laughing so hard that

    <br>recalled by Don Hayes<br>
    <p>This is the one about the time that Dimitri put a lighted cherry bomb in the chapter room bathroom.
    The first--and most obvious--question is "Why?"
    <p>Did Dimitri ever need a reason for anything he did?
    <img src="img/stories/toilet.jpg" height=200 align=right>
    <p>I think he thought it would be funny, but did not know that the fuse would burn under water
    (it has its own oxidizer and all that chemical stuff). So when everyone else split, Dimitri stayed until it went off. He got drenched, and the chapter room needed a new toilet.
    <p>If the chapter room had had a fan, the stuff would have hit it.

    <br>recalled by Don Hayes<br>
    <p>In our senior year, Charlie, Al and I were looking for any easy elective. John Lyttle strongly suggested Nuclear Metallurgy taught by Bob Macaig (I think he was a Pi Kap). It was sure to be easy and at least a B. Being lazy and desperate, we enrolled.

    <p>The course was easy and interesting, and Macaig was glad to have anyone in the class as it would have been dropped without a minimum number of students.

    <p>Having had an easy course and close to getting out, we were a little lax on final exam protocol. John, Al, Charlie and I sat in the last row of the class (nearest to the open window - May and no air conditioning) as Macaig started writing the test instructions on the blackboard (I do not know if this is considered to be politically incorrect). Suddenly, he turned around at the sound of "psst", "psst", "psst", and "psst' as we all opened a can of beer. Macaig just smiled and continued the instructions. He then left the room until the test was over.

    <p>To my dear brothers:
    I am honored to give this talk, and it is fitting to know that our dear fallen
    brothers are here with us this evening. When Schwabby asked me to provide this
    Eulogy, I found it difficult to develop specifics on each of our deceased
    brothers, so I thought it would be best to eulogize them with some historic
    events and to reminisce a bit. By doing this, you will be able to join with me
    and remember in your own personal and special way your connection with the
    brothers involved. These events were itemized in a very random thought process
    as they occurred to me, so they are not in any reasonable order.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

    <br>recalled by Roger Grice<br>
    <p>VW bugs were famous for low price, great gas mileage, and--perhaps most importantly--for looking the same frontwards or backwards. Al Theesfeld had such a car, and he parked it in front of the chapter house one day when the guys had more time and energy than was needed for school work.
    <p>A group went out, lifted the car, moved it away from the curb, turned it around, and then put it back against the curb. Being symmetrical, it didn't seem much different than it had before, until Al tried to get into it.

    <p>Things that were no longer needed sometimes found their way underground. (Jimmy Hoffa may well be resting there now.)

    <p>First, read what Don and Roger have to say.
    <p>One of the items buried in the backyard is ZAX, Vic Carbone's parrot. (ZAX is pictured in the photo section. He acquired a taste for vodka, but roosted too close to a drafty window.)
    <p>ZAX was buried with due ceremony in the backyard, near the center of the back fence. Sometime later a brick triangular monument surrounded by seven paving stones was erected in his honor over his grave. We would gather and pay homage to him from time to time.

    <br>recalled (with prompting) by Roger Grice<br>
    <p>This one also involves Al Theesfeld and things looking similar (like fronts and rears of VWs).
    <p>Al was returning to the house one night after a night on the town and found himself in front of brownstone #36. His key didn't work (or, he didn't have his key), so he decided to climb in the front window-something that many of us had resorted to from time to time. Unfortunately for Al, the 36 he climbed into was not on Sidney Place, and his reception by the man of the house was not too welcoming when he discovered Al in his bedroom in the middle of the night.
    <p>Al eventually found the 36 that is on Sidney Place.

    <div class = "story" id="38"><h3>Blue Baths</h3>
    <br>recalled by Roger Grice<br>
    <p>"Blue baths" is not so much a story as a tradition--one with a long and proud history.
    <p>The basics were simple: someone was thrown into a bath tub--almost always in the chapter room--filled with water and blue ink. While blue baths were often thought of as something done to pledges, the person tossed in could just as well be a brother. If you look through the photos on this site, you'll find a number of them with photos taken before, during, or after a blue bath.
    <p>Ink was a common commodity during the 60s, so arranging a blue bath was quick and easy, and they could be done spontaneously. I once asked how they were done in the 70s and 80s when ballpoint pens hand pretty much replaced fountain pens and was told that fabric dye was used.
    <p>During renovation of the chapter room bathroom (started in 2004), there was discussion of keeping a bathtub in there even though a shower would be more practical, solely because of the nostalgia value of the tub. Initial agreement was that even if a shower was installed, the tub should be kept around in some capacity as a link to the glory days of our past.

    <br>recalled by Don Hayes and Roger Grice<br>
    <p>Continuing on the theme of "blue" . . .
    <p>A drink that was popular for a while as the Blue Blazer--a shot of alcohol set on fire and consumed while it was still burning. If you got it to your mouth quickly and closed your lips around the rim of the shot class, there was not sufficient oxygen to support combustion (one of the few useful thinks we learned in Physics I), the flame went out, and all was well.
    <p>At a weekend party, Schwabby brought the glass to his mouth, but his aim was a little off. (Blue blazers' popularity increased as the night wore on.) The burning alcohol ran down the side of his chin, providing more entertainment (for the observers) than had been planned.

    <br>recalled by Don Hayes and Roger Grice<br>
    <p>The house heating system gave out one winter. (Not sure if it was the system or if we were just out of oil.)
    <p>Roger came back from class and walked into Room 2 to be greeted by Eddy's "I got something to tell you, Roomie."
    <p>As you may remember the larger bedrooms (rooms 2, 3, 6, and 7) had white-marble fireplaces, and Eddy figured that  if he started a fire in the fireplace . Made sense. Unfortunately, the fireplaces hadn't been used in a long, long time and had not been inspected since who knows when. One of the bricks in the flu was loose or missing, and the fire started a roof beam in 40 Sidney next door. The fire department put the fire out, but not before the fire had taken the roof of 40 Sidney out. Things eventually got put back in order, but we were quite a while without heat in the meantime.
    <p>A related story deals with a pledge who was doing a good deed and carried some bags of groceries into 40 Sidney to be a good neighbor. He noticed that he could see the sky by just looking up, figured what must have happened, dropped the bags, and hightailed it out.

    <br>recalled by Don Hayes and Roger Grice<br>
    <p>There was a costume party at the house on the same night that some group was throwing a dance at Poly. George Spira wore a toga (or, according to some recollections, a jungle loincloth) to the party. Sometime during the party, people thought it would be a good idea to kidnap George and dump him in the middle of the Poly dance. Someone had to explain the situation to Dean Middendorf on Monday, and legend has it that only some fast and smooth talking kept us off probation.

    <br>Recalled by Don Hayes<br>
    <p>Charlie Opalek, Al Ward, and I were in a physics 1 class and the following problem was given.

    <p>A cannon is mounted on a cart on a railroad track. A target is x meters away. The cart is moving toward the target at y meters per second. The muzzle velocity of the projectile from the cannon is z meters per second. At what angle must the cannon be raised to hit the target when fired?

    <p>With about 2 seconds of "thought", and absolutely no calculations, Charlie voiced the answer to the class of "14 degrees!" Ever since then, the universal answer to a question involving angles, temperature, etc. is "14 degrees Opalek."

    <p>By the way, the problem was insolvable as given. The projectile could never hit the target even if it went around the world several times.

    <div class = "story" id="51"><h3>Kelly and the paper transmitter (with pictures)</h3>
    <br>Recalled by Don Hayes<br>
    <p>The background for the story is that the ASME (the American Society of Mechanical Engineers) sponsored an annual contest to make something functional out a collection of "stuff". This year (1964 or 1965), it was a package of office supplies: 3 sheets of 8.5x11 paper, 2 #2 wood pencils, 4 paper clips, some "cellophane" tape, and 3 rubber bands.
    <p>See web site "Pictures-Golden Years-Don Hayes" page 1, row 4, pictures 2-4
    <p>Opalek and I having no idea what to do with this collection of junk, it was taken back to the house to get several beer-soaked brains working on the project. As luck would have it, the only "brains" at the house were Kelly and Kowalewski. After lubricating our brains and discussing the possibilities, Kelly convinced us that we could make a transmitter out of the supplies. At this point, it seem like a good and very doable idea - anything would. The paper would be the voice cone (picture #15), the paper clips would be the induction coil (picture #14), the lead from the pencil would be the coil core, with a rubber band to suspend the core. (We didn't let details like power source, detection, etc. get in the way. Kelly said it would work, and that is all we needed.) Picture #16 shows Kowalewski transmitting "Hello, Hello!" to a distant galaxy. We are still waiting for the reply. Who needs SETI?

We thought it would be a good idea to go there. Kelly volunteered to pay our airfare if we wanted to go. Another good idea (two in one night). Kelly calls PanAm and finds that there is a flight out at 11 PM. We are all out the door, with no luggage, and about to get into Kelly's Pontiac 4+4, when someone asked if we had our passports. I don't think any of us owned a passport then. So, it was back into the house to continue thinking new ideas, and drinking more beers.

    <div class = "story" id="52"><h3>Kastanos and the road trip to RPI</h3>
    <br>Recalled by Don Hayes<br>
    <p>One Fall evening, a few of us (some of the usual cast of characters, Kastanos, Carbone, Kowalewski, Ward, and I) were doing what we did best when we had nothing else to do - drink. Someone suggested a road trip. But, to where? Rutgers were snobs, UConn and MIT were too far, so RPI was the "logical" choice.

    <p>We all piled into George's '58 Olds, remembering to take some liquid refreshment and mixers from the liquor closet, and some entertainment (projector and 8mm films). (For some reason, Carbone was wearing a black cape. No reason to ask "why".) We arrive at the chapter house around 2 am, went to the Chapter room, and were greeted by an empty house. All the brothers were either out or in bed. So, we proceeded to set up the bar and the projector in the Chapter room, and relaxed for some more drinking and black and white, erotic movies. At about 4 am, one of the brothers returns to the house. After introductions, he told us that the door next to the movie screen (wall) was that of the Housemother. She apparently was deaf or had the good sense not to come out. We thought that it would be best to return to Brooklyn as the sun was just rising.

    <p>We all pile back into the Olds, and proceed south on the Thruway. About an hour later, we are on the Thruway with nobody anywhere in sight. We had not seen another car or truck since getting on the Thruway. All of a sudden, a State Trooper is pulling us over. He tells George that he made a lane change without signaling.  There was nobody in front or behind us at the time.  George was out of the car talking to the officer when he asked George what was in the trunk. At this point, we all are imaging what it is like to be in jail as "art" films were not considered to be acceptable, socially redeeming material. In fact, the were illegal. Carbone now has the cape over his head and is chanting something about not wanting to go to jail. Kowalewski is trying to shut him up so that the officer does not hear him.

    <p>There are some people who know how to handle a crisis, and George was one of them. To the officer's question about the contents of the trunk, George replies "Camping equipment. Do you want to see?" as he starts to insert the key into the trunk lock. The passengers are about to pass out or wet their pants as the officers says "No, that's all right. Just drive safely."

    <br>Recalled by Roger Grice (Actually, recalled by Teri--often and always at a public gathering)<br>
    <p>Summer road trips were a part of life at Theta-Upsilon in the early '60s. They usually started when classes ended, and in summer, that meant 10:00 PM. I thought they were part of my past when I graduated, got married, and started work at IBM (in that order). I was wrong, of course.
    <p>A week after Teri and I were married, I started work at IBM, and IBM put us up in a motel for two weeks until we could find a place to live in or near Poughkeepsie. While we were there, the guys called my parents' home and asked where we were staying. My mother told them that we were staying "in a motel somewhere on Route 9."
    <p>Around 3:00 AM, Teri shook me and said, "There's someone knocking at the door; it's your fraternity brothers." Never being one to wake up quickly or coherently under the best of circumstances, I told her "Open the door and let them in." That did not go over too well.
    <p>I got up, answered the door and was greeted by Don Hayes, Cal Gomez, and Harry Raymond. They told me that Charlie Opalek was with them but was in no condition to make it up the stairs to our second-floor room. I invited them in for a visit. We had some doughnuts lying around to offer as hospitality, and we had a lively, happy get-together until the motel manager called to say that people were complaining about the noise and that we would be kicked out if we didn't shut up.
    <p>Richie Seeger started at IBM the same day as I did, and he was staying in a motel in downtown Poughkeepsie. (I know, sounds like an oxymoron.) I told the guys how to get there so they could pay a visit to Richie.
    <p>I went down to the car with them to say hello to Charlie. Figured if he had travelled that far, I should make the journey down the stairs. Charlie was on the floor of the back seat covered with a blanket. When I moved the blanket, he woke up, looked at me, said "Don't interfere with a temperature-controlling device," and went back to sleep.
    <p>The  guys went off to visit Richie, getting there at about 4:00 AM. The next day at work, Richie and I had a bleary eyed lunch in the IBM cafeteria.

    <br>Recalled by Roger Grice; revisited by Don Hayes and Roger Grice<br>
    <p>While O'Keefe's was certainly the watering hole of choice during the school year and summers, the opening of school each September required something special. And the special was a trip to McSorley's, the legendary ale house in lower Manhattan that had been around forever and in the early '60s still did not allow women to enter. (In true McSorley's fashion, the owner/manager in the '60s was a woman. One day the patrons decided that women really were not allowed, so they threw her out. . . . . bodily.
    <img src="img/stories/mcsorleys.jpg" height=150 align=left>
    <p>On the night before classes, we would take the subway across the East River to lower Manhattan and enjoy a night at McSorley's--beer or ale, saltine crackers, sharp cheddar cheese, onion slices, and spicy mustard that sat out on the tables in uncovered beer mugs. A great way to greet the new school year.
    <p>Skipping forward many years . . . at Reunion 2002 Don and I stopped at McSorley's after the group trip to Ground Zero. The plan was to stop in quickly, then walk over the Brooklyn Bridge, and get back to Poly in time for the school tour. McSorley's was further away than we had thought (but as great as we remembered it). Our plan to get a taxi to the New York side of the Brooklyn Bridge and then walk over fell apart when we had difficulty getting a cab and wound up running late. We wound up taking a cab all the way back to the reunion hotel--the Marriott right across the street from Poly--and arrived on time and in style.

    <br>Recalled by Roger Grice<br>
    <p>One of the prime rules of Travelling Secretary visits was that there was to be no alcohol in the chapter house and, of course, no drinking. One week I had brought a frozen duck with me from my weekend trip home and was going to have it for dinner one night. Tony Gabriele and I were going to have a fancy duck dinner, which would (naturally) include wine. We went out shopping for dinner items to have with the duck and realized on our way back to the house that the bottle of wine we had was ver boten. Thinking quickly, Tony took the load of Italian bread from its bag, put the bottle of wine in the bread bag, broken off one end of the loaf and hollowed it out a bit, and then put it over the neck of the wine bottle. It looked like we had two loaves of bread--one in a bag, one not.
    <p>We cooked the duck in the kitchen and brought it up to the roof, where we enjoyed it with bread and wine. And no one was the wiser.

    <br>Recalled by Roger Grice<br>
    <p>The Fall '60 pledge class was a large one--twenty-eight guys were part of it at one time or another. We were lively and spirited, which is really just another way of saying that we were a rowdy bunch, determined to make our mark on fraternity life. We did.
    <p>There was a long-standing tradition of each pledge class pulling some sort of prank--often a kidnapping. (Side note: It turns out that in fraternity live "long-standing" often means "two or three years.) The Fall '60 pledge class wanted to be memorable, so we obtained a set of handcuffs to be used during the kidnapping.
    <p>Ronny Kowalewski was chosen as the kidnap--ee. After driving him around for a while, he was brought back to the house and handcuffed to one of the water pipes in the front room. A funny prank, but it turned out that the handcuffs were NYC Police issue, not something that could be picked with a paper clip, so a regular locksmith had to be brought in and given a story about how it was a prank and that Ronny was not an escaped criminal.
    <p>As part of the evening's festivities, a live turkey was places in the upstairs hall bathroom. When the door was opened, the turkey flew our squawking. Reportedly, a Brother who will remain nameless (but his initials are T McN) put the turkey out of its misery and prepped him to be a dinner item.

    <div class = "story" id="60"><h3>Drinking in Jersey</h3>
    <br>Recalled by Roger Grice<br>
    <p>Back when we were at Poly, the drinking age in New York was 18, and the drinking age in surrounding states was 21. It was a big thing for the 18-20 crowd to cross the line into New York so they could drink legally. During our senior year, a bunch of us decided that the really cool thing to do was to cross over into New Jersey so that only we big-shot seniors could drink.
    <p>One of the traditions was for a group of 21-and-overs to take someone to Jersey on the eve of his 21st birthday. We would go to a bar and order drinks for those who were 21 and have to show proof-of-age. The almost-birthday boy would order soda. At the stoke of midnight, we'd order another round with drinks for everyone. The bartender would know that something had changed and asked for proof-of-age for the person who had just switched from soda. And, of course, he could show proof.
    <p>One time, when I was well over 21.5 we were going to make a birthday run. Unfortunately for me, I had left my wallet at home on Long Island that week and had no proof of age. In that era before picture IDs, I borrow Richie Seeger's ID, which was close enough. When the bartender asked for proof, I handed over Richie's ID, and the bartender said, "Ah, a present!" After a slight panic at being caught with a phony (for me) I remembered that Richie had been born on Christmas Day, and said something casual about being a bonus gift from Santa.
    <p>There are also Jersey stories from the time we discovered that bottled liquor was cheaper in Jersey and that it could be bout in half-gallon and full-gallon bottles--unheard of in New York. Spontaneously created "Epsilon committees" would travel to Jersey before weekend parties to pick up supplies (and, of course, sample the wares on the way back to ensure quality).

    <p>As we all remember, O'Keefe's was the watering hole of choice. But O'Keefe's was civilized and occasionally closed for the night. One night while wandering around the northern part of Brooklyn Heights after O'Keefe's closing hour, we came across a bar that was still open. It was a walk-down in a row of buildings, not well marked, and really a pretty dreary place. But they were open at a really late hour. We stayed for a few rounds and left.
    <p>We wanted to keep track of the place in case we were ever out late, but didn't see a name on the bar. Looking around, we saw a sign for Pineapple Street, and dubbed the place "the bar on Pineapple Street." The problem was that it wasn't really on Pineapple Street, it was someplace from which you could see the sign while standing on Pineapple Street. We would sometimes go scouting for it, and we usually failed. (Of course, if we had had the wisdom to go scouting during the day, we probably could have found it, but our scouting instincts were not the greatest at 4:00 AM.) From time to time we would find it again, but our success percentage was pretty low.

    <br>Recalled fondly by Roger Grice<br>
    <p>This story ties in with "Metallurgy Final & 6 pack." Don Hayes and I finished up Poly and different times, but in similar spirits.
    <p>In my last semester at Poly, a took a statistics course as an elective--a night class at that. (Not sure why, but I did. At this point in my academic career, I was very much fed up with Poly and discouraged in general.) The instructor was a grad student in chemistry who always came to class in a white lab code--very weird for a math class. He told us that the rules of the game were: there would be four tests; he would take the highest three grades out of four; those three grades would determine our grade for the course.
    <p>In the time leading up to the first exam, I went to every class; I pulled an "F" on the exam. Between the first and second exam, I went to some of the classes; I pulled a "C." I didn't go to classes before the third exam, but I did go to the one class just before the exam to get the scoop; I pulled between a "C" and a "B" on the exam. Before the last exam, I didn't go to class, but before the exam I talked to someone who hadn't gone to class but who had talked to someone who did.
    <p>I went to the last class with Don Charlton and Vito Bassi, who were also in the class, bringing my cool attache case (which I often carried around with me, although not as faithfully as Pete Kelly did). It the attache case were a bottle of scotch and three glasses.
    <p>The instructor gave the exams back: I got a "B+" on the exam and a "B" for the course. he then proceeded with the two-hour lecture he had planned. I opened my attache case and poured three scotches--one for Don, one for Vito, one for me (being much more quiet than Don Hayes was in his story). We stayed there happily until the break and then left--very happy to be finished at Poly.

    <br>Recalled by Roger Grice<br>
    <p>This isn't really a story about things we did; it's a memory of life at Poly.
    <img src="img/stories/JaynMyrtle.jpg" height=200 align=left>
    <p>As you may remember, the Myrtle Avenue El ended right outside Poly (on the corner of Jay and Myrtle). I have memories of sitting in classes on the South side of Poly on the third or fourth floor--right next to where the train stopped. There was always clanging and banging and screeching--it drowned out the professors as they droned on. Interestingly, few of them bothered to stop droning--they kept on knowing full well (I would imagine) that no one in the class could hear them. I'm guessing that we probably didn't miss much.
    <p>One time a large truck drove down Myrtle Avenue and got stuck at the very end of the El's tracks--I guess the clearance was a little less at the end. It made a horrendous racket and attracted our attention for the duration of class. Eventually it got free; I think they let some of the air out of the tires to lower it a bit.
    <p>The picture with this story is an old one--before Poly was at its present location. The El used to continue westward though what is now Borough Hall and onward to Fulton Street. But when they built Borough Hall, they took out the last section of tracks so the train stopped at Jay Street. Hard to see in the photo on the web (but easily visible if your download the picture and see it full size); the street signs on the lamp post identify the corner as Jay and Myrtle.

    <br>Recalled by Roger Grice and Don Hayes and Ed Horvath<br>
    <p>The story of "the mural" spans many decades.
    <p>In the late '50s, Poly commissioned artist Andrew Tobias to create artwork for Poly. He created two stained glass panels that flanked the front (Jay Street) entrance to Poly. But his major work was to be a mural--"The History of Science" that would fill the wall that faced people as they first walked into Poly. It was to be a grand mural--large in scope, intricate in detail, and an artistic masterpiece. Tobias mixed his own paints using secret method that gave them amazing brightness and clarity.
    <p>The project started well--near the start of school in 1960, when many of us were just starting Poly and shortly after Poly's move and consolidation from Livingston Street to the current site at Jay Street. There was a lot of excitement about the mural--so much so that canvas barriers were put up around the mural to keep nosy passers-by from disturbing the artist. There were complaints about the cost--tuition was high enough--why pay exorbitant sums to this painter?
    <p>Progress on the mural slowed down, and a window was installed in the canvas barrier so that people could at least get some sense of what was going on.
    <p>Tobias died before the mural was completed, and it was sort of forgotten.
    <p>Poly received a large financial gift in the late 90s, and used some of the money to build a new building connected to the front of Rogers Hall ("The Poly" that we remember); this required creating a new main entrance, so the mural was no longer in the showcase position planned for it.
    <p>Fast forward some decades to the 2002 Reunion. A tour of Poly was arranged as part of the reunion, and the tour guides showed us all the progress that had been made--new labs, the large new dorm, a new library in its own separate building. Some of us asked about the mural. The question drew some blank stares and then the guides realized what we were talking about. They apologized, but told us that it was a construction area that was currently locked and unavailable for viewing. At the end of the tour, we left Poly and went across the street to the Marriott hotel to congregate in the lounge.
    <p><img src="img/stories/R0010063.JPG" width="200" align="right">A while later, Don Hayes and Ed Horvath came into the room bearing large, sh*t-eating grins. Don was waving his camera. After we had left Poly, they met a construction person and explained that they had to get into the locked area. They must have sounded convincing--they got in and took the pictures included in Don's Reunion 2002 photos.

    <p>Fast forward a year or two. A Founders Day dinner held at the Marriott featured a pre-dinner tour of Poly. We explained that we would like to see "The Mural." We were brought into the new gym that stands where the lobby once was. On one wall, behind a basketball hoop, mats were propped up along the length of the wall. The players and coaches very politely stopped the game and helped remove the mats. There was one wall of the gym, but protected by Plexiglass was the mural--unfinished just as it was when Tobias died. There were notes and sketches attached to the mural. It really would have looked good if it ever had been finished.

    <br>Recalled by Roger Grice<br>
    <p>A few months before Reunion 2006, Teri and I visited Charlie and Mary Opalek to catch up things and to talk about the reunion. (Marilyn and Ed Horvath dropped in too, and we all had a great time.) During conversation, Charlie admitted that he had never seen "Animal House"--the documentary about our days at 36 Sidney Place. Teri and I were shocked.<img src="img/stories/animalhouse-1.jpg" align="right">
    <p>A few weeks later, Teri and I found "Animal House" playing on TV, and we called Charlie and Mary so they could tune it in. We got a busy signal. Teri said, "How much could the DVD cost? Go onto amazon.com, order the DVD, and have it shipped to them." I did. (It only cost about $10 if you're thinking of buying it.)
    <p>During the reunion, we got to watch the DVD in Charlie and Mary's spacious stateroom, and enjoyed it greatly. (It's more fun to watch with a bunch of brothers than alone!)
    <p>Shortly after I got home, I saw an ad for a newly released book by Chris Miller (who co-wrote the script and was the inspiration behind the movie)--"The Real Animal House." I went to Barnes and Noble to pick it up, but I could not find it under new arrivals, humor, fiction--even biography. I asked for help, and the women led me to the section where it was--"Study Aids." I laughed: "Study Aids!?" She shrugged and said "It's college."
    <p>(It's a good book--I recommend it.)

    <p>Strange as it seems, I was in ROTC for two years. (I think it was to avoid having to pass a swimming test.)
    One of the most annoying parts of being in ROTC was getting up early to attend drills lead by very gung-ho Pershing Rifle officers.
    <p>At one drill, someone mentioned that if while everyone yelled out "YES, Sir!" you could yell out "YOU SUCK!" and it would blend right in. It brightened up the morning a bit. But little by little, people in the squad shifted the response away from "YES, SIR!" and one morning the group yelled out in unison: "YOU SUCK!" The lieutenant in charged turned beet red and screamed "<b>WHAT DID YOU SAY?</b>" and one cadet (who shall remain nameless to save me further embarrassment) called back "YOU SUCK, SIR!"
    <p>My ROTC career ended after my sophomore year.

    <div class = "story" id="73"><h3>Notes from Reunion 2002 (Brooklyn) Banquet Talk</h3>
    <br>Recalled by Roger Grice<br>
    <p>The theme of Reunion 2002 was "Time to Reconnect--with each other, with Brooklyn, with Poly, and with the active chapter." Here are notes from the talk I gave at the reunion banquet--held in the Brooklyn Bridge Marriott (right across the street from Poly), in the evening of the day that we visited Ground Zero.
    <p><p>
    <b>Time to Reconnect--with each other, with Brooklyn, with Poly, and with the active chapter</b>
    <p>This talk is not a bunch of stories about who drank how many beers. Of course, the interesting stories are usually about what happened after we drank the beers.
    <p>Instead, I'd like to reflect on the reunion theme: "Time to Reconnect--with each other, with Brooklyn, with Poly, and with the active chapter."
    <p>It is good to reconnect at various points in our lives; for many of us, it has been about 40 years. But really, the connection was never broken at all.
    <p>But much has changed.
    <p>At Reunion 2000, we had not been together as a group in a long time. There were many changes--noticeably heavier, noticeably grayer or balder. Few of us noticeably smarter. But there had been many changes in our lives.
    <p>It has only been two years since that reunion, so the changes are fewer, but no less important.
    <p>Since 2000, we have learned of the death of three brothers from our era: Charlie Gomes, Mike Dilligan, and Harry Henrickson.
    <p>Our families have increased--as new members arrived at the younger end, and diminished--as family members departed at the older end.
    <p>In many ways, we were all affected by nine-eleven.
    <p>Three bright spots are to be noted:
    <ul>
    <li>Chuck Schmidt has stepped up to help lead the house corporation
    <li>Nick Nesta, a brother from George Washington University, has stepped in to fill the vacant position of High Pi
    <li>The active chapter, after a weak and turbulent period, is growing and getting stronger
    </ul>
    <p>It was good to able to stand as a group on our visit to Ground Zero.
    <p>Let me briefly touch on some of our reconnections.
    <p><p><b>Reconnecting with Each Other</b>
    <p>What to say? There are so many stories.
    <p>Funny ones:
    <ul>
    <li>Blue baths
    <li>Olive races
    <li>Pete Kelly's electrodes machine
    <li>Ed Horvath burning down the house next door
    <li>Water balloons that <b><i>almost</i></b> made it across the street to Pi Kap
    <li>Road trips--that couldn't start until after night classes ended
    </ul>
    <p>Meaningful ones:
    <ul>
    <li>Helping each other pass courses
    <li>Being at each others weddings
    <li>Struggling through Poly--could we have made it without Lambda Chi and each other?
    </ul>
    <p>It was good to be at the house today, together as a group--in many ways still the same. We're still more rowdy than the actives.
    <p><p><b>Reconnecting with Brooklyn</b>
    <p>Much of the old neighborhood is still the same.
    <p>There are some changes:
    <ul>
    <li>The Myrtle Avenue El that clanged and screeched during class, often drowning out lectures, is gone
    <li>Sid's has moved
    <li>This hotel replaced the parking garage
    <li>Fulton Street is now a pedestrian mall
    </ul>
    <p>Some things are constants:
    <ul>
    <li>Sidney Place
    <li>The house (sort of)
    <li>Montague Street
    <li>The Promenade
    <li>The Bridge
    <li>O'Keefe's (even though it has gone a bit up-scale)
    <li>Great food in Brooklyn
    </ul>
    <p><p><b>Reconnecting with Poly</b>
    <p>It's still the same old razor blade factory, but it has a new front building, a separate library building, a dorm, and even some trees.
    <p>The mural is there--but it's locked up.
    <p>Room 116--home to those boring seminars--is still there, but it's been redone and is less crowded.
    <p>The bookstore and cafeteria are now by the main lobby rather than tucked away in the corner and up a flight of steps.
    <p>You need to show ID--and leave it with the guard--to get in.
    <p>The new dorm is fancy. Will it help the house by keeping students in the area? Or hurt it by attracting students to live there rather than at 36 Sidney Place?
    <p>New labs, new library, . . . but parts are still the same.
    <p><p><b>Reconnecting with the Active Chapter</b>
    <p>It was good to meet with the undergraduates and to have some of them here with us tonight.
    <p>At our last reunion in Baltimore, we mentioned that there had been some hard times for the active chapter. Here are some details.
    <ul>
    <li>In 1998--4 active members in good standing; we were the only fraternity on campus.
    <li>The chapter was scheduled no be closed down by National.
    <li>Don Hayes and Chuck Schmidt went to the General Assembly in Arizona to plead our case.
    <li>The chapter was not closed down, but a member review committee was commissioned to review each member and determine a status for each (good standing, probation, expelled), and the chapter was put under the control of an alumni advisory board.
    <li>Nick Nesta, from George Washington University, a member of the member review committee, agreed to serve the chapter as High Pi.
    <li>The chapter worked and struggled--rushed like crazy. They came to RPI for initiations (because of low chapter strength); got back to over 20 active members (a requirement set for by National); and were taken off probation.
    </ul>
    <p>Currently:
    <ul>
    <li>There are two other fraternities on campus
    <li>Our chapter strength is decent--15 active members
    <li>Thales Savas and Mike Davi have been keeping the house corporation afloat
    <li>Nick Nesta will be leaving the area for a job in Boston
    </ul>
    <p>It is time for us alums once again to pitch in and help the chapter and each other. The meeting at the chapter house today was a productive one--house corporation, newsletters, fund raiser, alumni volunteers to advise the chapter.
    <p>Remember the enthusiasm.
    <p>Remember the commitment.
    <p>We no longer live in Brooklyn, but we can help financially and electronically.
    <p><p><b>A big round of applause for Joe and Barbara Curtiss for organizing this reunion!</b>
    <p>Next year on the West Coast?

    <div class = "story" id="74"><h3>Memories of Hell Weeks Past--Hell Week Schedule</h3>
    <br>Recalled by Roger Grice<br>

    <p>I got to thinking of Hell Weeks of old (recently reread The Real Animal House) and was trying to patch together the many memory fragments into one coherent (OK, bad word choice there) schedule for that week of weeks.

    <p>Here's what I remember of Hell Weeks in the early '60s, but I don't trust my memory so much these days.

    <p><b>Sunday</b><br>
    	The week started sometime in the evening (was it 6:00?). The worms had met at a 	pre-arranged spot to get organized (true?). There was a formal picture of the 	group "in costume" and with paddles. (If we were lucky, a kindly brother took the 	paddles and hid the so they would not be destroyed.) Official playtime then 	started and went until 9:00. Then there were work projects until mid-night. That 	marked the end of the day, but informal playtime continued as long as anyone 	wanted it to.

    <p><b>Monday-Friday</b><br>
    	During the day, people went to classes, but worms had to be back at the house 	whenever they were not in class (even if they only had a one hour break). Dinner 	was at 6:00. Worms ate out (often on Montague Street) Monday, Tuesday, and 	Wednesday.

    <p><b>Monday-Wednesday evenings</b><br>
    	Study time (pretty much uninterrupted) was until 9:00. Playtime was until 11:00 	(or so), and then there was worktime until whenever.

    <p><b>Thursday evening</b><br>
    	Thursday was The Worm's Dinner-a pretty impossible event. Worms got 	harassed while they were preparing and serving it. Even if it was great, brothers 	complained and said it was lousy. Brothers were seated in strict zeta-number 	order; if someone arrived late, all those with a higher zeta number had to move to 	make room so that zeta-number order was preserved. After playtime (or as the end 	of playtime), the worms were brought into the chapter room as a group and asked 	one by one: If 	there were a big exam and you had to study hard to pass, but a 	brother needed your help in order to pass, and you could only do right by one of 	you, which would you choose? (Most people guessed wrong.) After this the 	worm's got to 	announce the choice of High Angel or HP. (The High Angel then 	got razzed unmercifully by the brothers.) Sometime during the night, there were 	Visitations-always interesting. At a time that was more Friday morning than 	Thursday night, a group went to the Fulton Fish market with Al Ward to get 	shrimp and fish for the Brothers' Dinner Friday night.

    <p><b>Friday morning</b><br>
    	Friday morning, the worms brought breakfast-in-bed to brothers at very specific, 	specified times. The breakfast items were often elaborate and the times quirky. 	And because the worms were very sleep-deprived at this point, the whole things 	usually turned out to be a mess, and brothers who were counting on the wake-up 	call sometimes missed classes. Also presented at the breakfast were items that had 	been requested: a count of the planks in the boardwalk at Coney Island, a 	distilfink, etc.

    	Friday was also a day of silence for the worms: they could not talk unless a 	teacher asked them a question in class. (The vow of silence hardly ever held for 	long.)

    <p><b>Friday evening</b><br>
    	While the worms were out of the house having dinner, the brothers got to enjoy 	The Brothers' Dinner-a more relaxed and organized meal than the night before. 	Seating was also by strict zeta-number order. When the worms returned, a very 	intense playtime ensured. It started with the worms crawling, single file, down the 	stairs from the main floor to the basement each carrying a lit candle. Brothers 	yelled "Keep that candle lit," while shooting water pistols or dumping water on 	them. Playtime , culminating in the worms running up and down the stairs rapidly 	while being yelled at. Eventually they were each dragged into one of the seven 	upstairs rooms and congratulated: Hell Week was over!

    <p>Some events that occurred throughout the week, not necessarily at scheduled times
    <ul>
    <li>Hell Week cocktail
    <li>Olive Race
    <li>Shoe shining (each worm had to bring a shoeshine kit with him to Hell Week; parts of it were usually "lost" during the week.)
    <li>Duck walking
    <li>Egg drop. Egg toss. Random things with eggs.
    <li>Carrying a raw egg to get signed by ten brothers (usually destroyed when a smiling Ronny Kowalewski announced "Oops, I forgot to dot the 'I'.")
    </ul>

    <div class = "story" id="75"><h3>Spirited Mail and the Seance</h3>
    <br>Recalled by Charlie Opalek<br>
    <p>During the summer, since few brothers lived in the house, we rented out rooms to outsiders to get extra rent money. One summer, an elderly lady who lived there for the summer kept complaining that
    her mail was being tampered with. No one ackowledged the tampering, so the running gag was that spirits were to blame.
    <img src="img/stories/mail.jpg" height=150 align="right">

    <p>One evening, Ronny Kowalewski and I walked from Poly to the house with a cubic foot of dry ice carried atop an 8-foot 2x10, with each of us safely distanced on each
    end to prevent getting burned. Ronny, Vic Carbone, and I decided we could use the dry ice to create a cloud of mist and hold a
    seance to contact the spirits who were tampering with the mail.
    <p>The dry ice did its part, and a seance-y mood was established. Just as the spirits were about to be contacted, Tony Chacharone burst into the house and loudly exclaimed "wtf is going on here?"
    The mood was broken, and the seance did not happen.
