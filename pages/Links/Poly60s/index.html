 <h2>The 60s--Poly and the World</h2> 
 <p>I received these two files from Poly as part of the publicity for an event geared for alumni from the 60s.
 A nice summary of what was going on in the world and at Poly back then (for those of us who have very vague memories of back then).
  
 <p>Here they are. Enjoy!
