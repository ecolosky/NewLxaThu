<H2>Family News</H2>
<p>Since last reunion, Kathleen and Mike had a baby boy--their fourth child, our sixth grandchild--and first grandson. His sisters are in school--Teresa in second grade and Anna and Frances in kindergarten. Laura was married last fall; we welcomed Jude Murphy into the family. Laurie's daughters, Brianna and Carissa, are both in high school.
<H2>Career News</H2>
<p>I'm still teaching at RPI, enjoying it but sometimes swamped with the workload. Teri's keeping busy as a fulltime grandmother, chauffeur, and pet sitter.
<H2>Hobbies, Achievements, Things of Note</H2>
<p>Fraternity still keeps me busy--High Pi at RPI and long-distance member of Theta-Upsilon's house corporation.
<H2>Memorable Undergrad Moment(s)</H2>
<p>Most of the best ones are written up on lxathu.com. Seeing what today's undergraduates have to go through--school administrations that work to keep them under their thumbs, event registration forms, and ever-changing policies and procedures, I'm very glad I was in school when I was. Fraternity was more about fraternity and less about school rules back then. And we turned out OK. (sort of)
<H2>Anything you'd like to add?</H2>
<p>Looking forward to a great reunion cruise. Thank you Charlie and Mary for setting it up.
