<h1>From the Reunion Directors--Charlie and Mary Opalek</h1>


<p>							
It’s official!  The Alumni Association has voted for it, and our e-mail survey is in favor of it.  The next reunion will be a cruise.  Here are the details.
<p>
The cruise will be 5-days, to Bermuda from Cape Liberty (Bayonne) NJ aboard Royal Caribbean’s Explorer of the Seas, leaving October 29, 2006.  
<p>Why October 29, 2006? Because it is at the end of the hurricane season, and being more than 12 months away, reservations at reduced prices can be had, and a full range of cabins are still available.
<p>Why 5-days? Because the vast majority of survey respondents wanted a cruise less than 7 days, and cruises any shorter than 5-days are extremely limited.
<p>Why Cape Liberty? Because this is the epicenter of the Brotherhood, is 3 miles from Newark Airport, 1.5 miles off the NJTP, with parking at the pier. 
<p>Why Explorer? Because we have traveled on its sister ship and thoroughly enjoyed the voyage.  It is 5 years old, 138,000 tons, 1,020’ long, 157’ beam, with 3,114 guest capacity, 3-story mall, ice rink, rock climbing wall, etc. 
<p>Why Bermuda? Because that’s where the ship goes. 
<p><p>
For more information on this cruise, the ship, cabins, prices, etc., go to rccl.com, or get a brochure from a nearby travel agent.  
<p>
I have secured the first 8 cabins necessary to get a group number.  (Thank you to those Brothers who sent checks to make this possible.)  Since RCCL only wants to deal with one person, as group leader, it will be necessary to forward deposits and other information thru me.
<p>
There are basically 4 types of cabins: inside, oceanview, balcony, and suite, with a range of prices and sizes within these categories.  Prices fluctuate daily with ranges from about $600 per person to over $1,700 pp.  The sooner deposits are made, the more likely we will be able to secure the cabin you desire.  We have purposely tried to book one year before, because prices do rise after that.
<p>
If you would like to attend, it is very important that we receive your deposit ASAP.  Final payment is due August 20, 2006.  However, you can get your full deposit back before that date.
<p>
With your deposit of $300, I will need:
names, addresses and phone numbers of both occupants
category of cabin
selection of one queen bed or 2 singles
<p>
If you have any questions at all, don’t hesitate to email or call me.
