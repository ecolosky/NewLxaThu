<h1>Reunion 2006 FAQs</h1>
<b>
<p>Here is a collection of frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the reunion cruise. If you have more questions, send them in. We'll get and post answers.
<dl>
<dt>Q: What are the dates of the cruise again?
<dd>A: October 29-November 2.
<p><dt>Q: Does that mean that we'll be in the Bermuda Triangle for Halloween?
<dd>A:  We are scheduled to be docked in Bermuda for the evening of October 31 on Halloween.  Actually, we don't sail thru the triangle.  Bermuda is the northern most point of the triangle, with Miami FL and Puerto Rico the other two points. 


<p><dt>Q: What time does the ship sail on the 29th?
<dd>A: 5:00, which means we have to be on board by 4:00 or so (that's when they pull up the gangplank). A group of people are planning to arrive at around 2:00. We can board as early as around noon, depending on whether the ship docked on time, on how quickly they can get the other passengers and their luggage off, makeup the cabins and make the ship ready for our cruise.  Sometimes they let you on and you have to wait in a public lounge for a while until your cabin is ready.  Sometimes you don't and go directly to your cabin.  There are a lot of variables here.
<br><font color="red">Important</font>:"IF YOU HAVE NOT CHECKED IN 60 MINUTES PRIOR TO DEPARTURE, YOU WILL BE CONSIDERED A NO-SHOW, AND YOUR BOOKING WILL BE CANCELLED AND CANCELLATION PENALTIES APPLIED"
<br> 
Everyone is urged to checkout the links on RCCLs website, 'Before You Board', and 'What To Know Before You Go' for additional information. 
<p><dt>Q: Is there anything special about time that day?
<dd>A: Yes. It's the day that daylight savings time ends. Be sure to turn back your clocks and watches.
<p><dt>Q: The ship will wait for me if I'm late, right?
<dd>A: <h2>Wrong!</h2>

<p><dt>Q: What is involved with the atmospheric and oceanographic lab aboard the ship?
<dd>A: <a href="http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/rccl">Check it out.</a> 
<p><dt>Q: Will we have access to a piano onboard ship?
<dd>A: No, but to you remember that electronic keyboard from Lake Tahoe that we all made Charlie and Mary carry home on the plane? . . .
<br>....we are working on smuggling the keyboard onto the ship.  Remember the machine gun in the violin case?  Well, we are looking for something that can disguise what it is.
<br>From Charlie: We asked rccl about providing a piano for us.  They told us a piano would "not be allowed in any conference room".  That said, we are still going to make the effort to get one on board.  If we are caught, I will tell them I practice everyday even when on a vacation.  (actually, the last time I practiced was in Tahoe, .... and it shows!).
<p><dt>Q: Will I have to sit with Charlie Opalek at dinner? 
<dd>A: Perhaps.  We won't know until everyone who is booked has made their final payment.  RCCL will keep us together as a group in the dining room at several tables.  As of now, your chances of having to sit with Charlie are about 1 in 5.
<p><dt>Q: Where will we find each other on the ship after we board?
<dd>A: The Schooner Bar would be where to look for members of the group. And the Schooner Bar should be easy enough to find.
<p><dt>Q: Will we be able to get a private meeting/gathering room away from the riff-raff on the ship?
<dd>A: The cruise line is letting us use The Bermuda Room (the Bermuda Room is one of four meeting rooms on deck 2.  Skating rink is nearby.) They will not let us have the room for whole days.  We left it at 5:00 to 8:30 PM (dinner time) the first night, and, 10:00 PM (after dinner) to midnight, or whenever, on final evening.   They said there would be no one there after midnight except cleaning staff, so I don't think they care how long we stay that night.  They also said that there is no "key," so we possibly COULD use the room at other times. 
<p><dt>Q: What kind of clothes should we bring?
<dd>A: There is no dress code during the day (other than decency). For dinners, "dress" shirts for guys (that generally means "anything with a collar." There will be one "formal night--date still to be determined.
<p><dt>Q: Anything special we should bring?
<dd>You might want to bring a 16 gauge extension cord, if you want to power things like a water pik in the bathroom.  The outlets provided are only a few dozen watts, enough to run an electric razor.  If you plug in anything else, such as a blender (ha ha), it probably won't operate.
 <p>
You might want to bring your own coffee mugs, larger than standard table-sized cups; this avoids the inconvenience of going up to the coffee urn for refills. You might want to bring a LXA mug (not implying that you defile the official beer mug, but there are coffee mugs--from the Baltimore reunion, for example).
