<p>Cruising Brothers:      

 

<p>There have been important changes in information previously sent.

 

<p>RCCL has changed both the telephone number for making final payment and the address to remit if you are choosing to pay by check.  The new telephone number to call with your credit card number and booking number is: 1-800-238-0166, #2 when prompted.  The new address is:  Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, 1050 Caribbean Way, Attention: Betty Gomez, Miami FL 33132.

 
<p>The good news is that RCCL has posted discounts for those over 55 years of age.  It covers most cabins, with Owner’s Suite being an exception.  They will need the date of birth of one occupant which should be verified when checking in.  You can inform them when calling to make final payment, or you may send us your date of birth and we will take care of it to make sure you get the discount.

 

<p>Final payment must reach them by August 20, 2006 or they are free to give your cabin away.  If paying by check they tell us it must be sent out two weeks before due date.

 

<p>The other information, as far as we know, remains the same as in the previous notice.
