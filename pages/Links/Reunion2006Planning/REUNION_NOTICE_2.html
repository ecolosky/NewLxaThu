<p>… And now, an update on the upcoming October 2006 LXA Reunion Cruise to Bermuda.

<p>We have booked 23 cabins so far.  You can go to www.lxathu.com to check out Brothers who are booked or contact me for that information.  To these Brothers: thank you for making this a viable reunion.  To the Brothers who have not yet booked, allow us to pique your interest in this reunion.  

<p>Explorer of the Seas is an immense cruise ship, an eye-popping behemoth of technology and style.  You will never be lacking for something to do.  And if you want to do nothing, that is okay too.  You will not tire of all the on-board activities available.  It is a mere $300 to secure a cabin, and this deposit is fully refundable if you cancel before August 2006.  The destination is very appealing, but it’s not the most important aspect of the trip.  The time spent traveling with your fellow Brothers is the trip.

<p>Those of you already booked are reminded to check in on-line.  Checking in on-line is easy and will make your boarding go quickly and efficiently.  Don’t worry, we will remind you about this again.  For those who have not yet booked, please go to Royal Caribbean’s website at www.rccl.com and check out The Explorer of the Seas departing October 29, 2006 to Bermuda for five days.  On this website you can see deck plans, compare staterooms, and read about land excursions.  I was recently asked if this cruise was for families also.  Yes, families and friends are welcome.  If you would like to book multiple rooms, just let us know.


<p>Remember, final payment is due August 20, 2006 and must be arranged by phone.  It cannot be done on-line.  More on that in the months ahead.

<p>When we started booking cabins, we were told by Royal Caribbean that passports to Bermuda would be required in 2006.  That has since changed.  The State Department realized this deadline was not feasible and it was extended from December 2005 to December 2006.  Though not officially required now, a passport is the most readily accepted form of ID.  If you need a new passport, arrange for one as soon as possible since processing times may take weeks or months.

<p>If you plan to fly to and from New York and are making flight plans now, here is some information you will need:  Royal Caribbean will provide airport Transfers for those flying into Newark or LaGuardia.  Ground transportation will bring you directly to the ship when you arrive and back to the airport when you return.  However, if you want to arrange for Transfers with Royal Caribbean, you must book a flight that arrives no later than 12:30 p.m., Sunday, October 29 and departs no earlier than 10:30 a.m., Friday, November 3. <p>You will be able to arrange and pay for Transfers when final payment is made to Royal Caribbean.  
For those who are driving, there is parking available at the cruise terminal.  The current cost for parking is $12/day.

<p>Contrary to popular belief, your Cruise Group Leader is not getting a free cabin at the expense of the group.  The deal is: for every 8 cabins we book, Royal Caribbean gives the group a ½ cabin credit.  The cabin value is based on the most popularly booked type of cabin.  Expense accounting and any leftover monies will be turned over to the next reunion organizer(s).

<p>We will be in touch soon.  If there are any questions, please don’t hesitate to call or email.
