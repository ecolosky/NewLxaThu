 <p>Seems hard to believe with all the bans on smoking these days, but cigarettes, especially Marlboros,
 were a big part of college life in the '60s. Marlboro reps were frequently on campus giving out sample
 packs; Marlboro sponsored an annual competition to see which campus group could collect and hand in the
 most empty Marlboro (and Phillip Morris) packs--that's how we won the house hi-fi; and they sponsored a weekly
 column in <i>The Poly</i>, the school newspaper.
