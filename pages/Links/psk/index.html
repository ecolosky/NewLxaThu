<h1>Defining, Calculating, and Representing <i>psk</i> Values</h1>
<b>
<p>Don Hayes and Roger Grice were reminiscing about Pete Kelly--things we recalled about what he had said, done, and was. Don suggested that Pete should be imortalized by having a mathematical constant named after him--the <i>psk</i>. We agreed that it would have to be a newly developed constant--most likely a <i>variable, multi-dimensional</i> constant that could be used to rate how closely a person, a specific action, or a group of action reflected Pete's spirit.
<p>We started developing the constant, and present it here for you perusal. It is truly a work in progress--and probably always will be so. It is suitable fodder for late-night discussions at reunions, gatherings, and other suitable events.
<p>Please feel free to add to, delete from, change, or amplify what is there. This should truly be a group fraternal effort.
