<h2><b>Revitalizing the House Corporation, Decline and Rebirth of the Chapter&#151;The 
  Late 60&#146;s through 70&#146;s</b> </h2>
<h2>Revitalizing the House Corporation</h2>
<p>A special meeting was <a href="6-11-70.jpg">called together</a> for Saturday 
  June 20th 1970 to discuss the reformation of the house corporation since the 
  mortgage was to be paid up in the next three years and the title to the house 
  had to be turned over to some entity, but to whom? If there was no person or 
  group to assume title to the house there would be a very serious problem. Meeting

<p>Recruitment for the house corporation and alumni chapter <a href="alumnigroups.jpg">were 
  being pushed.</a></p>
<p>In October of 1970, after several years of strained relations, the neighbors 
  at Sidney Place worked together to try and <a href="specialnotice.jpg"> kick 
  Lambda Chi off the block</a> and send them to a more suitable location. The 
  nieghbors were fed up with the garbage in front of the house, fire and structural 
  hazards in both houses, the noise level late at night, incedents of trespassing 
  on rooves of adjacent buildings, and alleged acts of hostility towards the neighborhood 
  residents. More details on this situation can be seen in the meeting minutes 
  between J.R. Lannon, Dean of Men, and representatives of Theta Upsilon Zeta, 
  Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity. Meeting <a href="min10-9-701.jpg">Page 1</a>, <a href="min10-9-702.jpg">Page 
  2</a>, <a href="min10-9-703.jpg">Page 3. </a> Needless to say <a href="1-21-71.jpg">legal 
  action</a> was then taken.</p>
<p>The need to reform the House Corporation was becoming very clear to many alumni 
  and the wheels <a href="2-11-71.jpg">finally began to turn.</a> It turns out 
  that, the House Corporation still existed, but under the name of Theta Kappa 
  Nu and very few of the board members remained . The corporation would have to 
  be renamed with new officers appointed. <a href="2-11-711.jpg">Details 1</a>, 
  <a href="2-11-712.jpg">details 2</a>, <a href="2-11-713.jpg">details 3.</a> 
  A letter was sent out to try and get a quorum of the <a href="reviv1.jpg">1942 
  directors.</a></p>
<p>Once quorum was attained a <a href="specmeetnot.jpg">special meeting of the 
  board of directors</a> was announced. At this meeting several items were discussed 
  such as the welcoming of new members, renaming of the corporation, and the idea 
  of electing new officers. <a href="specmeet1.jpg">Details 1</a>, <a href="specmeet2.jpg">details

<p>On April 3rd 1971 <a href="alumnom5-3-71.jpg">nominations for new officers 
  and directors</a> of the house corporation were finally made. The election was 
  to take place on May 22, 1971, which would also mark the first official meeting 
  of the House Corporation in 27 years. All the proposed directors were elected 
  unanimously at the meeting. The house corporation was up and running once again, 
  but with a new name selected: Theta Upsilon of Lambda Chi Alpha Corporation</p>
<h2>Mortgage Burning September 9th 1972</h2>

<h2>Deline and Rebirth of the Chapter</h2>
<p>In June of 1976, Theta Upsilon Zeta of New York Poly, once a thriving chapter 
  of 60, was down to only 3 senior brothers. These remaining brothers were left 
  bearing the burden of a $100,000 historical landmark brownstone house in a metropolitan 
  area where annual expenses approached $8000 a year with no allowance for the 
  much needed maintenance and repair.</p>
<p><br>
  Luckily for this chapter it had a handful of caring alumni. Bill De Lamater, 
  Bob Schwab, Don Hayes, Joe Giardina, and Tony Ammaral, all sat down and discussed 
  and came up with,&#147;When we started our alumni chapter in 1966 we agreed 
  not to interfere with the active chapter and to remain available for assistance 
  only upon request of the actives. Such request has not come and soon the chapter 
  and the house that holds the memories of our college days will be gone. Therefore, 
  I move that we violate our bilaws, take charge of the fall rush, and stay in 
  charge until a healthy, active chapter exists.&#148; The chapter had tried something 
  similar to this back in 1974. <a href="alumint1.jpg">details 1</a>, <a href="alumint2.jpg">details 
  2</a></p>
<p><br>
  Bob Schwab became the overall coordinator; Don Hayes was in charge of getting 
  the list of the incoming freshman and sorting it for mailings and personal contacts, 
  as well as acting as a liaison with national; Joe Giardina was in charge of 
  preparing the overall plan and supervising it&#146;s execution; Tim Kamel, responsible 
  for contacting alumni and soliciting their aid and their participation in meetings; 
  Steve Gentile, in charge of contacting Freshman initially by letter and then 
  arranging follow-ups with phone calls for a pre-school rush on August 14th and 
  for the main rush on September 9th; Bob Conroy was in charge of physical preparation 
  of the house; and Harry Raymond for food, drinks, posters, handouts, etc.<br>
  The first step was to devote pre-school rush to the incoming freshman class 
  from Brooklyn Technical High school, since that score high scholastically and 
  the school typically supplied about 25% of the Freshman class. They also have 
  already formed friendship groups so may come with friends.</p>
<p><br>
  The list of 35 target candidates was developed and rules were set up about contacting 
  and rushing the candidates:</p>
<p><br>
  1. No lying. We may only have three active brothers but we have more spirit 
  and alumni support than our competitors.<br>
  2. Don&#146;t promise anything that you can&#146;t deliver.<br>
  3. No negative selling. Sell our strengths, not our competitors weaknesses.<br>
  4. Don&#146;t apologize for our present state. Stress the opportunity available 
  to a new initiate to participate in the development of the chapter and his own 
  character.<br>
  5. Encourage the candidates to visit all fraternities and then choose the one 
  he prefers. He will prefer us because we are the best.</p>
<p><br>
  On August 14th, of the 35 invited, 22 replied saying that they would attend, 
  and 17<br>
  actually showed up. All the events scheduled for the day went according to plan 
  and by the end of the day five candidates associated with the house.</p>
<p><br>
  With pre-school rush behind them, the brothers are now more confident and were 
  eagerly preparing for rush on September 9th. In addition, Frank Maes and Greg 
  Schmall from national headquarters join in offering valuable assistance to the 
  preparation of this rush. This time around several hundred candidates are invited 
  to the events.</p>
<p><br>
  On the day of rush there is a booth set up to attract more candidates to the 
  house. Posters and handouts are used, as well as raffle tickets. To see if you 
  had won the raffle you had to take a trip to the house where the winning number 
  was posted. At the house there were activities taking place. Eight more candidates 
  are associated by the end of this day and within the week following.</p>
<p><br>
  Don Hayes, John O&#146;Brien, and Steve Gentile, each with the title of one-third 
  Kappa formed a team to educate the group of aspirants. Approximately two months 
  later the group is ready to be initiated. John O&#146;Brien assumes the duties 
  of Hi Phi and with the assistance of twenty rusty alumni performs an initiation 
  ceremony.</p>
<p><br>
  Now that there was a somewhat sizeable group of brothers the development phase 
  had to begin. The appointed officers were sent out to run the chapter with the 
  alumni watching over their shoulders. Alumni attend the chapter meetings and 
  social events as the junior actives developed into strong, responsible, devoted 
  brothers. These brothers all take their roles seriously and the chapter begins 
  to come alive again.</p>
<p><br>
  Not only was the chapter solidly getting back on its feet, but before the semester 
  was over they had two young men who had been pledges at other fraternities de-pledge 
  and come knocking on LXA&#146;s door looking to associate. These two had come 
  in contact with the new initiates in the class and liked what they had heard 
  over what they were already receiving at other fraternities. Later, those two 
  young men became dually initiated brothers of LXA.<br>
  The enthusiasm of the chapter carried into what would historically have been 
  an uneventful rush. Instead the chapter initiated another 3 brothers.</p>
<p><br>
  The rebuilding house was then on to the Fall Rush of 1977. The institute began 
  to over react to the low on confidentiality of personal information by refusing 
  to release the list of freshman to fraternities. Each house was only allowed 
  one mailing which had to be approved by the dean. The letters were written by 
  the house, but the mailing information was affixed to the letters by the school. 
  There was no way of providing follow-up since the house would never see the 
  addresses of the potential candidates. How would the house get around this major 
  obstacle?</p>
<p><br>
  The chapter figured that LXA letters would have a small chance of being read 
  by the incoming freshman, but a letter from the institute, that would be. The 
  mailing was then constructed as a questionnaire where the candidates would list 
  their interests and most importantly his contact information which had to be 
  returned within two weeks. Constantinos Chantzis was made to sign the letter, 
  but not with his actual given name. Constantinos nickname given by the house 
  was Deanos &#150; translated into English is Dean. So, Dean Chantzis signed 
  the letter with the given title &#147;chairman&#148; to make it appear an official 
  document from the school. Within two weeks contact information of the candidates 
  was obtained and pre-school rush was up and running.</p>
<p><br>
  Joe Giardina then contacted the alumni offive of the Institute and obtained 
  permission to deliver a five minute speech to the incoming freshman at orientation 
  on the importance of fraternities. The speech was presented by Frank Bloise, 
  the sophmore high Alpha. Frank&#146;s presentation style attracted much attention, 
  which gained him and the house recognition. After the presentation candidates 
  were shuttled 40 miles to the chapter house where fall rush was just beginning.</p>
<p><br>
  At the end of the rushing season the numbers were released. Of the five fraternities 
  on campus three received zero associates, one received one associate, and LXA 
  received ten!</p>
<p><br>
  On April 21, 1978 Theta Upsilon conducted its first Founders Day celebration 
  in five years. It was attended by seventy actives, alumni, and wives. The celebration 
  was also attended by a very special guest, Dr. S George Dirghali, who came all 
  the way from Syracuse. Doc was impressed and inspired by the feeling of brotherhood 
  that filled the room. &#147;It is real. The chapter is alive and well.&#148;</p>
