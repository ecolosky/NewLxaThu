<p>The chapter continued to occupy rented space at 40 Sidney Place. (40 Sidney Place is to the left of the current chapter house as you face it from teh street.) However, without warning, the chapter
was ordered to vacate 40 Sidney Place after having occupied the house for sixteen years. This action on the part
of the owner was a result of his desire to change the nature of the quarters in order to increase its
income. After a search for a suitable house, the house corporation purchased a
three-story brownstone house at 36 Sidney Place, redecorated it from top to bottom, and
refurnished it throughout. The money for the new building came from a building fund started in
1927 and a loan from the general fraternity.  
<p>The chapter house at 36 Sidney Place was purchased in August, 1940 by the New 
  York Alpha Alumni Association of Theta Kappa Nu Fraternity, Inc. (the House 
  Corporation) from Blanch Barclay. The cost of the house was $9,000, of which 
  $2,000 was paid in cash. This money had been given to the House Corporation 
  by alumni who had paid their pledge of $100 after graduation. The bulk of the 
  money was obtained through a voluntary insurance plan. The remaining $7,000 
  was obtained through a mortgage held by Banker’s Trust Company. An additional 
  $3,000 was needed for repairs. $500 of this was supplied by the House Corporation; 
  the remaining $2,500 was received from the General fraternity in the form of 
  a second mortgage. 
<p>Under the agreement with Banker’s Trust, the House Corporation was to pay $87.50 
  interest and $50.00 amortization per quarter for the period 1940-1945. Elles 
  M. Derby, who was treasurer of the House Corporation, took care of most of the 
  troubles that beset the house. 
<p>Shortly after the house was opened, the chapter was unable to raise the $50 
  amortization fee, although it did pay the interest. The bank threatened foreclosure, 
  and Mr. Derby managed to make the payment. The House Corporation supervised 
  the management of the house and rented the parlor and dining room to the active 
  chapter for $110.00 per month. The membership at this point had fallen to sixteen, 
  and the drafting of men into the army left the chapter with 40% vacancies instead 
  of the anticipated 20%. In addition to this, the active chapter fell four months 
  behind in rent payments. Thus, in March, 1941, the House Corporation was without 
  funds to meet the mortgage payment. Not wanting to lose the house, Mr. Derby 
  presented the case to the Grand High Zeta. They agreed to loan Mr. Derby $137 
  each quarter in order to pay the bank. 
<p>In April, 1941, Mr. Derby closed the house because of lack of interest and 
  support on the part of the active chapter. The house took in boarders, and renting 
  it presented little difficulty. Because of the change in status of the house, 
  Mr. Derby was able to make two quarterly payments to the bank without having 
  to borrow money from National. 
<p>A short time after this, a complaint was received from the City stating that 
  the room rent rates had not been filed with them Mr. Derby submitted a list 
  of such rates and received back a report stating that the rates were too high. 
  The matter was finally settled, and the rates remained the same. A note from 
  the Building and Housing Department followed; it stated that the house was to 
  be inspected. As a result of this inspection, the chapter was obliged to install 
  a sprinkler system and a fire-wall, which was to be placed in the cellar stairwell. 
  Because there was no means to remove these violations, it was necessary to close 
  the house completely in 1943. 
<p>In May, 1944, the principal mortgage on the house was transferred to the Grand 
  High Zeta. There was a total of $6,484.61 left on that mortgage. The balance 
  on the mortgage originally held by National raised this figure to $10,531.40. 
  There was an additional $2,571.94, which represented unpaid interest to Banker’s 
  trust. This amounted to a grand total of $13,103.34. 
<p>On V.E. Day, 1945, Mr. Derby was informed that many people were seen entering 
  and leaving the house. At that time, only the caretakers, Mr. And Mrs. Riley, 
  were supposed to be living in the house. An investigation revealed that the 
  Rileys were renting out the house. Mrs. Riley gave the money to Mr. Derby with 
  the explanation that they wished to surprise him with the receipts on Christmas. 
<p>The house was reopened after the war. In 1948 the undergraduate chapter again 
  started making payments to the House Corporation. The payments were $225 per 
  month for the eight months of the school year. This represented a fifteen-year 
  contract at 4% interest. At this rate, the active chapter should have owned 
  the house outright in 1963. However, there was much trouble with building violations 
  and back taxes. This delayed the date of the final payment. 
<p>In Spring, 1964 (when this initial part of the house’s history was compiled), 
  the balance on the mortgage was $5,000. The active chapter paid the House Corporation 
  $350 per month for the eight months of the school year. Baring further crises, 
  it was anticipated that the house would be paid for in 1970. 
<p>Of note: In 1961, room rent was $13.00 per month, which included bed linen 
  and towels. By 1964, it had risen to $14.50, but no longer included linen and 
  towels.
