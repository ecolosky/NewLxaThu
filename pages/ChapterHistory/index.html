<p>The chapter started out as a local fraternity, Theta Lambda, in 1920.
Legend has it that Theta Lambda applied to become a chapter of Lambda Chi Alpha but was turned down.
Lambda Chi Alpha recommended that Theta Kappa Nu might be a better match for the local fraternity,
so Theta Lambda applied to Theta Kapp Nu and wa accepted as the thirteenth chapter of Theta Kappa Nu.
When Lambda Chi Alpha and Theta Kappa Nu merged in 1939, we finally did become a chapter of Lambda Chi Alpha.

<h2>New York Alpha Chapter of Theta Kappa Nu-January 24, 1925-
October 11, 1939</h2>
<p>Theta Lambda became New York Alpha of Theta Kapp Nu on January 24, 1925.
<p>Here is Theta Kappa Nu's coat of arms.
<img src = "pages/ChapterHistory/TKNcoat.jpg">
<h3>Theta Kappa Nu Badge</h3>
<p>The Theta Kappa Nu badge consists of four equilateral triangles, signifying
the four pilars of Theta Kappa Nu--virtue, learning, patriotism, and fraternity.
The three outer triangles are gold with black enamel. The triangles may contain no jewels, four pearls,
or two pearls flanked by diamonds in each corner. The triangles contain the letters Theta, Kappa, and
Nu, in gold. The central triangle is gold with black enamel. In its center is either a five-petaled gold Tudor
rose or a diamond if it is a founders badge. The rose or diamond is surounded by the Syriac numeral for "11,"
representing the eleven founding chapters of Theta Kappa Nu.

</table>
<p>The chapter house at 36 Sidney Place was purchased in August, 1940 by the New York
Alpha Alumni Association of Theta Kappa Nu Fraternity, Inc. (the House Corporation)
from Blanch Barclay. The cost of the house was $9,000, of which $2,000 was paid in
cash. This money had been given to the House Corporation by alumni who had paid their
pledge of $100 after graduation. The bulk of the money was obtained through a voluntary
insurance plan. The remaining $7,000 was obtained through a mortgage held by Banker's
Trust Company. An additional $3,000 was needed for repairs. $500 of this was supplied
by the House Corporation; the remaining $2,500 was received from the General fraternity
in the forma of a second mortgage.

<p>Under the agreement with Banker's Trust, the House Corporation was to pay $87.50
interest and $50.00 amortization per quarter for the period 1940-1945. Elles M. Derby,
who was treasurer of the House Corporation, took care of most of the troubles that beset
the house.

<p>Shortly after the house was opened, the chapter was unable to raise the $50 amortization
fee, although it did pay the interest. The bank threatened foreclosure, and Mr. Derby
managed to make the payment. The House Corporation supervised the management of
the house and rented the parlor and dining room to the active chapter for $110.00 per
month. The membership at this point had fallen to sixteen, and the drafting of men into
the army left the chapter with 40% vacancies instead of the anticipated 20%. In addition
to this, the active chapter fell four months behind in rent payments. Thus, in March, 1941,
the House Corporation was without funds to meet the mortgage payment. Not wanting to
lose the house, Mr. Derby presented the case to the Grand High Zeta. They agreed to loan
Mr. Derby $137 each quarter in order to pay the bank.

<p>In April, 1941, Mr. Derby closed the house because of lack of interest and support on the
part of the active chapter. The house took in boarders, and renting it presented little
difficulty. Because of the change in status of the house, Mr. Derby was able to make two
quarterly payments to the bank without having to borrow money from National.

<p>A short time after this, a complaint was received from the City stating that the room rent
rates had not been filed with them Mr. Derby submitted a list of such rates and received
back a report stating that the rates were too high. The matter was finally settled, and the
rates remained the same. A note from the Building and Housing Department followed; it
stated that the house was to be inspected. As a result of this inspection, the chapter was
obliged to install a sprinkler system and a fire-wall, which was to be placed in the cellar
stairwell. Because there was no means to remove these violations, it was necessary to
close the house completely in 1943.

<p>In May, 1944, the principal mortgage on the house was transferred to the Grand High
Zeta. There was a total of $6,484.61 left on that mortgage. The balance on the mortgage
originally held by National raised this figure to $10,531.40. There was an additional
$2,571.94, which represented unpaid interest to Banker's trust. This amounted to a grand
total of $13,103.34.

<p>On V.E. Day, 1945, Mr. Derby was informed that many people were seen entering and
leaving the house. At that time, only the caretakers, Mr. And Mrs. Riley, were supposed
to be living in the house. An investigation revealed that the Rileys were renting out the
house. Mrs. Riley gave the money to Mr. Derby with the explanation that they wished to
surprise him with the receipts on Christmas.

<p>The house was reopened after the war. In 1948 the undergraduate chapter again started
making payments to the House Corporation. The payments were $225 per month for the
eight months of the school year. This represented a fifteen-year contract at 4% interest.
At this rate, the active chapter should have owned the house outright in 1963. However,
there was much trouble with building violations and back taxes. This delayed the date of
the final payment.

<p>In Spring, 1964 (when this initial part of the house's history was compiled), the balance
on the mortgage was $5,000. The active chapter paid the House Corporation $350 per
month for the eight months of the school year. Baring further crises, it was anticipated
that the house would be paid for in 1970.

<p>Of note: In 1961, room rent was $13.00 per month, which included bed linen and towels.
By 1964, it had risen to $14.50, but no longer included linen and towels.

<h1>Some Stuff About Poly</h1>
<p>I've collected some stuff about Poly from the Internet--a lot of it from eBay. I include it here for whatever
interest it may have.
<h3>Some Old Photos and Ads</h3>
<p>These came from eBay. Obviously, these were taken before Poly moved to 333 Jay Street.
<p>The original building of the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, known
until 1889 as the Brooklyn Collegiate and Polytechnic Institute, was
erected in 1854 at 99 Livingstone Street. Its first classes contained 250
male students in the collegiate and preparatory departments. In 1958,
the Institute moved to more modern quarters on Jay Street",
