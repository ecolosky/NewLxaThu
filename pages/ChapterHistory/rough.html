<h2><b>Another Rough Spell</b> </h2>
<p>After the work to rebuild the chapter in the late 70's, the chapter was once again alive and well.
The chapter received Lambda Chi Alpha's Phoenix Award at the General Assembly. (The award is given to a chapter that, like the legendary phoenix, rises from its own ashes.)
<p>Operations continued successfully for some years, but then the chapter started to decline once again. 
Membership numbers declined and academics (always a problem at Poly) suffered badly. When the ELC visited the chapter in 1998. he recommended that it be shut down. There were four members in good standing, finances were in very poor shape, and there were a number of instances documented of the chapter not living up to Lambda Chi's standards of operations. Don Hayes and Chuck Schmidt went to the 1998 General Assembly in Arizona to plead the chapter's case and to save them from being closed down.
<p>The chapter was not closed down, but it was put on serious probationary status. The chapter was put under the control of an Alumni Control Board and had to make periodic reports to fraternity headquarters. Headquarters staff also convened a member-review committee to interview each active brother and associate member and recommend who should remain active, who should be put on probation, and who should be expelled. (The committee was chaired by Roger Grice and had as members Steve Ubelhoer and Chris Grossman of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Nick Nesta of George Washington University, who was to go on to become the chapter's High Pi, the first, it is believed, High Pi to come from outside the chapter.)
<p>Through a lot of hard work and effort, the chapter increased its membership to 20, straightened out its finances, and came into compliance with Lambda Chi's standards of operation. The chapter was restored to good standing in 2000.
