<h2><b>New York Alpha Chapter of Theta Kappa Nu—January 24, 1925— October 11, 
  1939</b></h2>
  <p>
  <p><b>(The founding of Theta Kappa Nu fraternity and history of the chapter as New York Alpha of Theta Kappa Nu)
<h3>The Founding of Theta Kappa Nu Fraternity</h3>
<p>Theta Kappa Nu was formed at a time when the Interfraternity Conference believed that there was a need for more national societies and urged the amalgamation of of various local groups into national fraternities.
<p>Eleven local societies gathered together in 1924 for the first organizational meeting of Theta Kappa Nu. Leaders of the group working for the formation consulted lambda Chi Alpha and adopted many features of that fraternity's organization features and policies. Officers of the two fraternities, which had much in common from the very beginning, remained friends throughout the parallel history of the two societies.
<p>The eleven founding groups, chartered as chapters of Theta Kappa Nu on October 11, 1924  were:
<ul>
<li>Phi Alpha Sigma, Drury College 
<li>Tau Lambda Delta, Rollins College
<li>Kappa Delta Psi, Iowa Wesleyan College
<li>Phi Sigma, Gettysburg College
<li>Phi Kappa Nu, Howard College
<li>Tau Lambda Delta, University of Florida 
<li>Tau Lambda Delta, North Carolina State College
<li>Tri Kappa, Hanover College
<li>Sigma Delta Chi, Simpson College
<li>Phi Beta Omega, Baker University
<li>Phi Kappa, Oklahoma City University
</ul>
<p>Theta-Upsilon became the sixteenth chapter of Theta Kappa Nu, on January 24, 1925. We were named new York Alpha chapter of Theta Kappa Nu.
<p>The four men credited with planning and accomplishing the merger of the original eleven societies were:
<ul>
<li>Ortho R. McAtee, Drury
<li>Winslow S. Anderson, Rollins College
<li>the Rev. Jerry H. ("Doc") Krenmyre, Iowa Wesleyan
<li>Donald F. Lybarger. Gettysburg College
</ul>
<p>The fraternity flower, a white Tudor rose, had eleven petals and four stamens, to recognize the eleven local societies and the four "founders."</b>

The shield was silver and contained five black chevrons. A crimson inescutcheon appeared in the center
of the shield. A knight's helmet in silver and crimson was above the shield, and above the helmet was a crimson lion rampant with a white tudor rose slipped proper. Below the shield was a silver banner with the fraternity motto "Vir Quisque Vir Est" in crimson.

<h3>Theta Kappa Nu Badge</h3>
</font></b> 
<p>The Theta Kappa Nu badge consists of four equilateral triangles, signifying 
  the four pilars of Theta Kappa Nu--virtue, learning, patriotism, and fraternity. 
  The three outer triangles are gold with black enamel. The triangles may contain 
  no jewels, four pearls, or two pearls flanked by diamonds in each corner. The 
  triangles contain the letters Theta, Kappa, and Nu, in gold. The central triangle 
  is gold with black enamel. In its center is either a five-petaled gold Tudor 
  rose or a diamond if it is a founders badge. The rose or diamond is surounded 
  by the Syriac numeral for "11," representing the eleven founding chapters of 
  Theta Kappa Nu. </p>

<h3>New York Alpha of Theta Kappa Nu</h3>
<p>Theta Lambda became New York Alpha of Theta Kappa Nu on January 24, 1925. 
Theta Kappa Nu's naming scheme for chapters included the state in which the chapter was located and an indication of the order in which chapters in that state were established. We were the first chapter in new York State, so we were named the New York Alpha Chapter of Theta Kappa Nu Fraternity.
<p>The chapter continued to prosper as Theta Kappa Nu. A house corporation was formed in
1927 under the urging of Campbell, DeGroot, Hotchkiss, and Gerhardt. A system of building
fund contributions was initiated in the following year. 



<p>
<b>The Certificate of Incorporation of New York Alpha Alumni Association of

  George A. Gebhardt, Robert B. Ogden, Arthur W. Bothmann, and Carl H. Nelson</b>
