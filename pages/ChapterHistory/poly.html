<h2><b>Some Stuff About Poly</b></h2>
<p>I've collected some stuff about Poly from various sources.  
  I include it here for whatever interest it may have. 
<h3>Some Old Photos and Ads</h3>
<p>These photos of Poly are of the Livingston Street building--before Poly moved to 333 
  Jay Street. 
<p>The original building of the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, known until 
  1889 as the Brooklyn Collegiate and Polytechnic Institute, was erected in 1854 
  at 99 Livingstone Street. Its first classes contained 250 male students in the 
  collegiate and preparatory departments. In 1958, the Institute moved to more 
  modern quarters on Jay Street.
